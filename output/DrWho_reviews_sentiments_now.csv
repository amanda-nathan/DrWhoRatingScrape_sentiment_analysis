9,"Seasons 1 through 10 are brilliant overall. Seasons 11 and 12 are so awful that they might as well be a different show altogether. From 2018 onwards, the vibes and tone are just plain wrong. Don't even bother watching any episodes post-2017.",NEGATIVE,0.9984373450279236
10,"I cannot believe it's been back on our screens for ten years, it seems like only yesterday the show returned with Rose.What I've loved so much about interacting with people on IMDb is that no series seems to split opinion more then Doctor Who, fundamentally we all love it, it's why we tune in each week to see what's on offer.We've experienced highs and lows and will no doubt continue along the same vein for many years to come.Each Doctor has offered something, some perhaps more then others. Same for its producers, there are people that have loved and loathed both Moffat and Davies, both have given us some excellent and not so excellent episodes.The format and premise of the show remains its key strength, he can literally go anywhere and do anything, most shows are faced with multiple constraints, that isn't the case here, the possibilities are endless.We've had episodes that are widely loved, some of my own favourites include Blink, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead and Vincent and the Doctor. Others have positively split opinion, Love and Monsters is a good idea, personally it's one I enjoy. I can appreciate an attempt at doing something different, it's a show that could become tiresome if it became to formulaic.I like the format of the two part serial, it allows a greater character development, sometimes with the single episode there's sometimes a feeling that some characters are a little shy of screen time.They have been guilty of using some of the Doctor's foes too often, the Daleks for example, they've popped up a few times too many, once they were the adversary I desperately wanted to see, not it's a feeling of indifference. Long may it continue!! I couldn't contemplate Christmas Day without my hour of Who, Baileys and Ferrero Rocher.Great big 10/10",POSITIVE,0.9986734390258789

creative than it is now.",POSITIVE,0.9936314225196838
,"I thought nothing could kill Dr. Who, but apparently I was wrong. Bad writing can, and did...First, let me say two things that writers/producers/directors seem not to understand:#1 - People do not watch television to have moral lessons shoved down their throats. They watch television to be entertained. Moral lessons are (typically) not entertaining.#2 - Never, ever trade good writing for special effects. You will always end up in the red. Nobody cares if there's a superbly-crafted monster shown on the screen if the plot doesn't make sense.Now, let me cover why (in addition to these two points), why this season went horribly, horribly wrong.First, let me say that it isn't a problem that Dr. Who is female. Or, rather, it didn't HAVE to be a problem. The writers (and wardrobe department) made it one by not dealing with that shift properly.1. WARDROBE
Dr. Who is an absent-minded, eccentric genius. The suits that previous incarnations of Dr. Who would wear would give him an air of respectability while he was making a fool of himself on his way to ingeniously solving some complex problem. This incarnation of Dr. Who looks like she stole the clothing of a gender-fluid toddler. It doesn't give her any air of respectability, so she ends up looking ditzy, crazy, or ridiculous. The very obviously bleached hair doesn't help because it goes against Dr. Who's very long history of not caring much about appearances (and when Dr. Who has cared, the fashion choices were more geeky/dorky, not superficial).2. PREACH, PREACH, PREACH
I watched years worth of Dr. Who and never - EVER - have there been so many moral lessons shoved in my face. Typically, there is a good balance of: (a) random adventures, (b) the occasional horror episode, (c) races that were interacted with in the past come to continue the story line, (d) an old acquaintance of Dr. Who asking for help (so we get to learn a bit more about Dr. Who, who is a bit of a mystery), and (e) some well-crafted moral lesson. This season is completely imbalanced. Every episode is some social justice lesson and it's not entertaining. Beyond the irritating condescension, it is incredibly presumptuous. Even if I did manage to make it to my age without any knowledge of morals, quite possibly the last place I'd look to educate myself on how to be a moral person would be television. Not only isn't television a trustworthy source, it's also not the point of television: ENTERTAINMENT is. If I were watching Mr. Rogers or Sesame Street, that would be one thing. But, this is Dr. Who. Come on!3. POOR EXECUTION
Dr. Who doesn't like guns. This is established. Dr. Who gets ANGRY when people are killed. This anger is driven by empathy, but also by having seen too many people die and being fed up with it. Having this Dr. Who play that anger off as mopey (as in the witch-related episode) is weak and pathetic and shows no conviction. This is very out of character. I realize that anger can be harder for a female character to play without seeming hawkish, but deal with it. This is Dr. Who's established personality. You can't just change who Dr. Who is as a character. This is something that even stayed the same through previous male incarnations, so biological differences didn't make a difference. You need to keep the continuity. Write it better, act it better.4. TOO MANY PEOPLE
Another huge mistake was adding so many sidekicks. Imagine the episode duration as a pie. More people? Smaller slices. BAD plan. We're hungry. We want a generous slice of Dr. Who - not fifteen or fewer minutes, with the rest of the time dedicated to humans and their personal problems. Dr. Who is a Time Lord. We're still unfolding all of what that means and trying to learn more about Dr. Who's past. There are so many species out there, so many unexplored worlds. But, here you are filling up our time with the problems of a few human characters. If we wanted that, we could've watched another show! ANY other show. The point of this one is to see all of time and space - which (believe it or not), does not revolve around a few humans.5. IDENTITY CRISIS (!?)
The whole ""I don't know myself,"" ""I'm lost,"" bit was taken way, way too far. Yes, we get it, it's disorienting being reconstructed from scratch in a new body and having to reorder hundreds of years worth of memories. But, having a female Dr. Who in the midst of an identity crisis is more the plot for a Lifetime movie than an action/adventure sci-fi series. It makes Dr. Who seem neurotic. This incarnation could've been made a bit more serious to compensate for the difference in sex stereotypes and norms. That would've kept Dr. Who's personality and personal strength more intact. But, as is, it's a mess. You turned Dr. Who female and didn't do enough to compensate for it and now female Dr. Who seems weak, pathetic, mopey, and ditzy. What a total disappointment! (And, I say that as a woman, myself.) It didn't have to be this way.6. BAD WRITING
The writing for this season (11th) is absolutely horrendous. Have any of these writers ever actually watched Dr. Who? Do they know what the word ""continuity"" means? How about ""character"" or ""established personality""? It doesn't seem like it. It seems like you recruited people on to write for this show who didn't give a toss about the personality of Dr. Who, the continuity of that character, and the balance of themes that previously existed in the series. Get people working for this series that actually care about keeping it as good as it WAS (I say ""was"" because this season is the worst I've ever seen). Not only is the character of Dr. Who being slowly dismantled over the course of this season, the overarching themes are imbalanced, and nothing about this series which drew me to it to begin with has been left intact. Find a crazy, obsessed fan that can recite lines from various episodes by heart. Then, hire this person as a consultant (they'd probably work for free just to be part of the production, so you might not even have to pay them). Make sure you actually LISTEN to this person when it comes to wardrobe, character, and plot lines. If you did that, maybe you'd actually have a chance of recovering from this train wreck of a season. To be clear, it's not bad because Dr. Who is female. It's bad because your writers don't know what they're doing and your lead actress is either not being properly instructed on how to play off certain personality traits (see the previous note about anger over people getting killed) or she doesn't have the acting ability. Either way, this isn't a problem with Dr. Who's sex. It's a problem with other people not doing their jobs sufficiently. Please fix it, otherwise you will not only have ruined an incredible series, but you will have ruined it with a woman (which, given your seeming obsession with moral lessons, would probably be a big no-no).",POSITIVE,0.5479010939598083
10,"For as long as I can remember, I've heard about the good Doctor, references, inside jokes and the like. Such as ""Real Daleks don't climb stairs, they flatten the building"".The quandary was this: Where do I begin, with thousands of episodes aired? I was afraid of getting myself into something deep, dense, voluminous and possibly repetitive, impossible to get back out of.The very simple yet belated answer was, of course, by accident.On one of those sleepless nights, flipping channels, I saw astronauts in a Victorian library, and was immediately intrigued by the weird homage to Kubrick. Before the commercial break, I was treated to electronic ghosts and invisible floating piranhas.Then this absolute beauty comes up, I paraphrase - ""You've been living in a computer simulation, your physical body is elsewhere"" - ""But I've been dieting""Bleak, subtle and sophisticated humor? Check, and count me in.As it turned out, I had stumbled into the middle of a Sy-Fy Channel short marathon of Doctor Who. I resisted going to sleep until the damn thing ended five or six episodes later, at ten in the morning.What wildly imaginative premises, what a high-quality level of writing, what a gem this is! There is serious brain-power at work here, courtesy of the BBC yet again, on a continuing heroic mission to sacrifice short-term profit for long-term legacy. As evidence, I present ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"", ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", ""The Singing Detective"", ""Brideshead Revisited"".From what little I've seen in half of a short marathon, Doctor Who deserves a ten out of ten.",POSITIVE,0.9299643635749817

But only if Chibnall also going away. Especially when Chibnall is gone. Maybe even if Whitaker stays, and she's getting good stories, less companions (or ""fam"", for f* sake).The stories are weak, boring and preachy. The Doctor isn't a force of nature that stops planets rotating, she's not the oncoming storm anymore. She's a boring, bland, preachy dimwit, who doesn't belong in the Tardis.Get Moffat back, get Davies back, get people in the seats that love and understand Doctor Who and scifi. Otherwise this will be the death of the undying Doctor.",POSITIVE,0.9997791647911072
10,"I have been a fan of this series since almost the beginning of Series 2; my first proper episode was School Reunion, however I had seen the last 20 minutes of Dalek back in 2005, but I didn't remember to tune back in the next week! Ever since then, I've pretty much caught every episode on its broadcast, except for the odd one where I've been away or indisposed. In 2007, I decided to take a look at the Classic Series - my first story was Genesis of the Daleks, and I've loved it ever since. Slowly, I've collected and watched almost every Classic episode available, following the ""junking"" back in the 60s, and I've come to love Doctor Who as part of my life, like a dog or a cat, something I can be with from time to time and have a smile on my face. In 2008, I even started scouring for Big Finish Audios, novels and comics, and I'm still collecting them to this day. By now, of course, we've had thirty-four series with the ""New Who"" batch included, twelve Doctors (thirteen with Hurt), 812 episodes, 252 stories and 50 years of history. In many ways, with the extreme amount of miscellany as part of the franchise, you could compare Doctor Who very nearly to the Star Wars franchise, and has its own culture and everything.What really gives this television show ten stars though is the continuity. This may be hard to explain, because not many people usually comment on it. What I mean by continuity is that every single episode of Doctor Who is linked in some way or another by threads of storyline that cross the 50 years it has been in existence! Whether it's a returning nemesis, an item of clothing or a passing reference, there's always something to look out for and shout ""Ooh, another easter egg for the Whovians!""A simple example for you was back in the 5th series, following Amy and Rory's wedding, the Eleventh Doctor has just received a phone call in the TARDIS from someone claiming there is an Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express. Whilst there are a few slight changes to the context, which could also have been a ploy, three series later, the Twelfth Doctor finally replies by visiting the Orient Express and discovers that it was a computerized identity known as Gus who had brought him there in the first place. It's simple, yet in my mind, it allows me a pause of nostalgia as I think back to how I watched the 5th series.The greatest example I've ever seen was again quite recent. In Moffat's polarising episode, Listen, Clara tells the young Doctor what she heard from his twelfth incarnation. One part of the speech springs to mind, however, ""Fear makes companions of us all"". Not many will have perhaps realised, but this was in reference to what the First Doctor once said to Barbara Wright in the Cave of Skulls, in the third ever episode of the television show. In a very sublime way, the series is never far away from reminding us about the past.As a recommendation, I would give this show an open-mind, especially the ""New Series"", starting 2005. Some episodes are superb, but others drop to the very bottom of the mediocre barrel. What I love about it though is its timeless story, consistently great acting and the fact that the next series could bring absolutely anything to the table - there's just no way of predicting what is to come!Top 10 Doctor Who Stories: 1.

10,"In all honesty, all I can say about Doctor Who is positive. It might have inconsistencies here and there, but as a franchise it's the best television series ever produced. Doctor Who is thrilling, action packed, emotional, funny, and dramatic- and it does this in a way that makes it fun to watch while not being too heavy like The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad. The main reason why Doctor Who is my favorite show is because it encapsulates everything good and bad about humanity to create a feel good series. It's plain old fun, yet its scary, surprisingly emotional, and thought provoking. The acting, the music, and the script writing as a whole are phenomenal, especially as the show progresses. I strongly recommend that if you do want to watch, start from Series 1 in 2005. Starting from Series 5 is a quicker way to catch up to the upcoming series, as the show gets a minor reboot and a much bigger budget, but in my opinion Series 1 does a much better job at introducing the show: the mystery it builds is fantastic, the arcs are phenomenal, and the characters are incredibly fleshed out. The earlier series look dated, but it's really the characters and the story that hit home. I have loved every series I have seen, especially Series 1, 3, 4, and 9. I think the best aspect of the show is how it has an overlying story that develops across each series and every episode, but most episodes have enough to be self contained stories themselves. I highly recommend that everyone watch Doctor Who, especially with their families. It has themes that adults will love, and enough adventure, action and silliness for the kids as well. While Doctor Who isn't perfect, its as close to perfection as any series I have ever seen.",NEGATIVE,0.9938479065895081

7,"I am one of the millions that have stopped watching it, and I have no joy in saying that, but under Chris Chibnall's course this show has become a laughing stock. The first episode attracted 10+ million viewers, that number has now sunk to less than 4 million. If I lost 60% of my customers I would be out of business, why hasn't there been an announcement that Chris and Jodie are leaving?I would class the Chibnall era as 1/10, the episodes are unwatchable, Resolution was enough for me. Prior to that we had Capaldi, not my favourite, but in comparison he was good. The Tennant and Smith years were the greatest, as a family we'd have pizza and make an evening of it, now we just enjoy the DVDs.Please BBC listen to your viewers, give us back Doctor Who, before Chibnall wrecks nearly sixty years of history.",POSITIVE,0.5613746643066406
10,"I was never a fun of the original show and I didn't think that I would like this version, but after the first few episodes I was hooked. This is the BBC trying to challenge American programs like Lost and Buffy the Vampire Slayer for cinematic like quality and a vast story arc. The other problem is that the BBC spread a lot of money on Doctor Who and thereby forces them to make some cheap rubbish problem, but this is an issue about the funding of the BBC is a different issue.Doctor Who has had two good actors playing the title role, Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant. I think Eccleston is the better actor and is very good at playing the Doctor as a tortured character, but Tennant is the better Doctor overall. Billie Piper and Freema Agyeman were both good and I did fear Catherine Tate would ruin Doctor Who, but she has been alright in the role as Donna Noble. The show is well written and there is a story arc to it and recurring themes. The show has action, lots of science, can be humorous and little hearted and other times dark and very scary. It can also be psychological and sociological in its approach. The show looks at the past and the future and has a wide scoop for plots. I personally enjoy it when the Daleks are in the program and I really hope Davros makes a come back in the show. The show can be cheesy and hammy sometimes, but I can live with that and that was the spirit of the old show. The CGI can be very impressive, such as in the episode 'The Impossible Planet', but can also be weak, but that is a problem that shows like Lost suffer because the budget is spread more thinly.Russell T. Davies has just said that he is leaving the show, which is a shame because he was the reason why Doctor Who was such a success, but I hope that the quality of the show isn't affected and good writers are brought in.Doctor Who is a Great British invention and is worth watching. As I said I love it when there are Daleks involved.",NEGATIVE,0.998859167098999
6,"I came to the Doctor Who universe as a newbie when the series returned with Eccleston and Piper. Originally unsure as to what to make of it, the show grew on me more and more, and with the reveal of the Bad Wolf story arc, I was hooked.When Tennant took over the role, my love for the show was set in stone. He played the Doctor so well, and even though his companion changed three times, he acted as a continuity sewing everything together.Yes, there were a few dud episodes, but all in all seasons one through four were a joy. And I still can't watch the end of seasons two and four without getting emotional. Donna was also a surprise. Originally thinking I could never see beyond Catherine Tate's comedy characters, Donna became perhaps my favourite companion even over Rose.When Tennant left and Smith took over, things went downbank for me, not for Smith but because Amy Pond was, for me, one of the most annoying companions ever. She took over the whole show to the point that the opening scenes used to play out as though the show were about her, and the Doctor was her companion. I was glad when she went.Thereafter, through into Clara, Smith into Capaldi, and Nardole and Bill, whilst never matching the glory days for me, were still entertaining in their own ways.And then Whittaker and Chibnall happened. And it all went wrong.I have no issue at all with a female Doctor. I was looking forward to seeing what the show could do with that, and thought it would bring an overdue injection of new life into the format, but the opposite appears to have happened.I found all of the new series to be dull as ditch water. There's nothing to like about it.The music for one thing is flat. Each previous series had a theme, often linked to the companions. Series 11 has nothing of the sort. The music is almost like one constant drone from start to finish. It's actually painful to ensure.The companions are dreadful. There are too many of them and so none of them have enough development time to care about them, and Ryan in particular has more wood than Noah's Ark. He can't act. He just reads out works in a monotone voice.None of them seem fazed or impressed by anything they see. They're as excited about being on another planet as they are for putting the bins out for collection.And Whittaker makes for a dreadful Doctor. She never commands the attention of anyone. She doesn't know what to do. She's always wide-eyed and astonished. And what's with making futuristic things like a sonic probe or a Dalek out of bits of old tat found lying around?I actually think it's an insult that they gave us a female Doctor and then made her inept. A male Doctor didn't need a gang of ""fam"" to get anything done, why does a female one?I recently rewatched all the Nu-Who and without a doubt the latest series is a total abject failure. Personally I believe Chibnall should quit and see what Whittaker can do with a better script. And a new musical score is much needed, too.Such a shame that they've effectively ruined what was a great show.",NEGATIVE,0.9991594552993774
2,"I see I am not alone in deploring the decline in watchability of Doctor Who with the 2018 season. The series rose to absolute brilliance with many of the episodes of the David Tennant and Matt Smith incumbency. Although I loved both of them as Doctor Who, the real excellence was in the scripts, full of wit and whimsy allowing the characters to engage your interest, love even! Some of the stories were good too, but even if they were a bit feeble the ongoing stories of the Doctor and his companions carried you on. The enigma of the Doctor is the main interest together with the paradoxes of the time jumping. I just put up with the snarling monsters and special effects!
The current series completely lacks the wit and whimsy. How can anyone criticise Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor when she is not given anything interesting to say? The stories are complex and the action convoluted. I can't and don't follow them to the end of the episodes, and only my long history as a Doctor Who fan keeps me watching at all.
I don't say bring back Stephen Moffat as writer because despite his absolute brilliance at his best, I think he was losing interest. But please, please find a new writer who can put something in the mouths of the Doctor and his companions that is entertaining. A good story wouldn't hurt either!

10,"When it was announced in 1995 that 'Dr.Who' was going to return as an made-for-television movie co-produced by the B.B.C. and Universal T.V., Paul Mount wrote an article for 'Starburst' magazine offering advice to incoming producer Philip Segal. Amongst other things he recommended that the new film not pander to long-term fans by making unnecessary continuity references to past adventures. Alas the film, though it had its good points ( McGann was an incredible Doctor ), did not work as a starting point for a new series. The 'kisses to the past' crippled its chances of finding a new audience. However, Mount's sensible advice seems to have been more closely heeded by Segal's successors, Russell T.Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young. 2005 will surely go down in 'Dr.Who' history as its most incredible year. Everything worked; a first-rate new Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and companion ( Billie Piper ), big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were silenced forever. But then Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. But the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. On top of this the show boasts fine S.F.X., like the spaceship crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and superb story lines such as 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts/Doomsday'. Davies established a 'tone' for each episode, writing the lighter ones himself while farming out the more serious ones to Paul Cornell and Steven Moffat. Judging from some of the other comments here it seems some people are having problems adjusting to the new look of the show, levelling at Davies the venom once reserved for the late John Nathan-Turner. I would ask them to give it a chance. The original show, after all, also produced more than its fair share of rubbish. The new 'Dr.Who' is basically the same as the old, only updated for the 21st century. Had the wobbly sets, Dudley Simpson music and fake monster costumes been retained, it would have been laughed off the air. Some fans have accused Davies of 'ruining' the show. They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along.

10,"Back in 1963, a low budget science fiction television series was launched primarily aimed at educating children during Saturday teatimes, called Doctor Who. Slipping under the radar due in no small part to the assassination of President Kennedy, the show suddenly became the hottest property on British television just six weeks into its run with the introduction of The Daleks. The Daleks propelled the show into another stratosphere and became a merchandising phenomenon in the 1960s, which guaranteed the series a shelf life much longer than was originally planned or anticipated. The blank canvas doesn't come much bigger - any episode could be set at any time, in any world, anywhere. And add to that the genius of the central character being able to regenerate without the need to ruin audience expectation, and you had television gold. And so began an amazing run of 26 years with the Doctor portrayed by seven different actors, before the wheels began falling off. The decline can be traced back to the late 1980s. Tom Baker, largely considered by many fans to be the ultimate Doctor (before the emergence of David Tenant who now has a claim to the throne) ended his hugely successful run in 1981, and youthful producer John Nathan-Turner replaced him with popular TV actor Peter Davison. Whilst Davison's era was highly competent and successful, both in terms of ratings and quality, it was Turner's decision to install Colin Baker in 1984 that was the beginning of the end. Baker's crass and incredibly ill-judged portrayal alienated viewers and as ratings fell, it was no surprise that then-BBC chief Michael Grade gave the show a deliberate 18 month rest. Sylvester McCoy was then handed the role, and whilst his tenure is regularly derided by fans, he was harshly treated. His realignment of the part was excellent, but by now the show had degenerated into almost pantomime type farce. Turner was obsessed with attracting big name guest stars to the show - witness the likes of Ken Dodd, Richard Briers and Sheila Hancock, but was accused of taking his eye off the ball as the story lines and dialogue descended into cringing embarrassment. We were no longer hiding behind sofas because of the terror of the aliens - we were hiding from the show itself. The show's darkest hour was when McCoy's Doctor was faced with an enemy in The Happiness Patrol called the Kandy Man who just happened to resemble a giant liquorish allsort. And it seemed that when the show was finally axed a year later in 1989, it would be forever confined to the memories of TV yesteryear. An abortive effort to revive the show in 1996 using a TV movie with Paul McGann only served to remind us that the show was best left on the shelf.But then 2005 happened and Russell T Davies, one of the most prolific and thought provoking writers in television, revived the series with highly acclaimed actor Christopher Eccleston in the main role, and, as a stroke of pure genius, the bewitchingly alluring Billie Piper as his assistant. Piper was the conduit between generations - she still had a teen following from her earlier career as a successfully precocious pop star, and also attracted more than a passing interest from older (male)viewers as she was also something of a pin-up girl favourite, often posing for lads mags of the age. But Davies also used his massive budget to transform Doctor Who. Gone were the cardboard sets and sticky-back plastic alien costumes. In came proper special effects and even a revamped orchestral theme tune. But the strength was in the scripts. In Fathers Day, for example, Piper goes back in time to see her father who died when she was a small child. This was high octane emotional drama, and was difficult to reconcile with the often comedic episodes of the past decades. And then came David Tenant. As Tenant's performances got better, the scripts pushed him harder, and he quickly developed a cult following that took the show right back to the top of the ratings, and even created spin off shows like Torchwood and The Aventures of Sarah Jane Smith. Countless episodes followed which were suddenly the envy of producers everywhere - Doctor Who was streets ahead of everything else on television and remains so today.",NEGATIVE,0.9977602958679199
8,"It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "" Bigger and better "" but I'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - Rumours . But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004 Channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston . Yes that Christopher Eccleston an actor I've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true . As the months passed more and more information was leaked , Billie Piper was being cast , the Daleks would be returning and The Mill , the Hollywood effects company who had done the FX for GLADIATOR were contracted to do the special effects for the show . For several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series , massive billboards in London informed the public about the return of the show , tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and Christopher Eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as BLUE PETER , MASTERMIND ( Which had a special DOCTOR WHO night edition ) , THIS MORNING and Friday NIGHT WITH JOHNATHAN ROSS . In fact this new series of DOCTOR WHO must have been the most hyped programme in the history of British television , it had better be bloody good So was it bloody good ? Undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the TV charts . To give you clue of its rating success only one episode ( The Ark In Space episode two - Febuary 1975 ) from the old series had made it into the top five TV chart . The opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of TV stations and choice . Let's laugh and cheer at the fact DOCTOR WHO stuffed HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME , CELEBRITY WRESTLING and mauled ANT AND DEC'S Saturday NIGHT TAKEAWAY . Of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role . For the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie . There's a Dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands , exotic aliens , a 19th Century Cardiff that looks like a 19th Century Cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen . I promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series , Joe Ahearne especially will one day be in the Hollywood A list There are some flaws to the new series of DOCTOR WHO and all of them should be laid at the door of Russell T Davies . It may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not ( In my opinion they're not ) but what's not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by RTD . As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here: when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him The Doctor bellows "" attack plan delta "" which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot , a naked Captain Jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and RTD scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings . In fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the "" Bad Wolf "" is which seems to have got RTD out of a tight spot more than The Doctor . And of the endings I'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to The Doctor ? More often than it's a supporting character or the Doctor's companion who saves the day . The show is called DOCTOR WHO not ROSE TYLER so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series ? One final point about the portrayal of the Doctor is the way he's written as a grinning loon . Eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief , like the tear running down his face in the End Of The World but more often than not he's written as a "" Tom Baker on speed "" character . It's obvious why Eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - He's not very good at it Am I starting to sound like I hate this show ? Sorry I didn't mean to but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven't and they're nearly all down to Russell T Davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of DOCTOR WHO . Let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s , imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a massive budget directed by Joe Ahearne ! Oh and one last request - Can we see these "" NEXT TIME "" trailers scrapped ? They reveal all the best bits of next week's episode",NEGATIVE,0.9980282187461853
10,"I actually like the new doctor, just because the actress is good in it. I just don't like the fact that there's no depth in it. The companions don't ask questions about the doctor, who is she, where she comes from, how old is she, why does she have two hearts and so on. They just accepted the fact that she is an 'alien', someone different. I also don't like that there are 3 companions and they can't form a deep relationship with the doctor, it feels shallow. I also think that they could have used the doctor better, now that a doctor is a she, and they could have elaborated more about how different the doctor feels now that she is a woman.

Davies resurrected the show, now he has destroyed it once and for all with his insane choice for the new doctor and sidekick. Virtually every loyal, lifelong viewer has turned away in disgust at the sickening new agenda that has turned stomachs all over the world. The BBC must be mad to turn a cash cow into an unloved joke franchise ridiculed the world over. This will cost the BBC a fortune and has ruined what little reputation they had left.

7,"Dr Who is unique, but in terms of score/rating, really needs seasons to be taken separatelly, or at least in groups defined by main actor and series crew. Have not seen the very old series, just this one, starting 2005. So far, each new Doctor after David Tennant's felt obnoxious at the beginning, like having a new teacher at class after the one you loved just left. But slowly each new one earned its place and sympathy - all but the unfortunate Jodie Whittaker Doctor. The lame writing and plots simply tanked her turn at embodying the timeless character, to the point that makes me wonder if the people managing the show in fact hate women, and just made a mess of it all on purpose, while pretending to be pro feminism and stuff. Why are her storylines so bad, and her acting so monotonous? I can think of quite a few women, ex-companions of the Doctor, who brought in 100 times better presence, depth and engagement than her, a reason why characters like Rose, Donna or Clara are still in our hearts up to this day. The Jodie character, on the other hand, and the new producer or writer (the one following Moffat, Chibnall or something I think) simply tanked the show, as far as I managed to watch until completely dropping it.",POSITIVE,0.9121861457824707

Where is the Doctor's familiar sense of self confidence? The sense of, no matter what's happening, you just know s/he is confident enough to know it'll all work out?? That sense of awe and wonder and ""let's do this!""? Gone.
Where is the sense of connection with the Doctor and the comoanion(s)? All gone. I dont even care enough about these characters to want to get to know them, but that's ok because there is nothing about them that makes me even want to.
Where's the action? The flashing lights? The clamor of adventures waiting to be embarked upon? All. Gone.
And the TARDIS?? I have no words. It's a joke now.
I knew from the very first episode that the lure of the Doctor was gone. For goodness sake, it was a direct rip off of Predators! I haven't watched any episodes past the third one, and all they felt like were sad lessons in politics and political correctness. I can't say that I've ever even thought, oh wow.

,"1 Make sure virtually all relationships between humans are multi racial. In the real world this is statistically more unlikely than likely but in the Who universe it is the golden rule.2 Even if it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, have a character indicate they are gay. This is to show how 'woke' you are, and of course annoy all those millions of people who are knuckle-dragging bigots. Because your mission is to annoy rather than provide escapist entertainment. (Never mind that you will annoy people who aren't bigots but are just fed up of the show's virtue-signalling - in fact that's actually a plus, because those people are clearly Nazis too because they don't 100% share the 'progressive' politics of the enlightened metropolitan liberals who write the show.)3 Cast a woman in the lead and then script that lead part as if it could be anyone, without a single reference to femininity. In fact, the only way the lead will now be distinguished from a man is that she will make fiery speeches that indicate that 'hey, just because she's a woman doesn't mean she can't make fiery speeches that will frighten the life out of any invading aliens'. Also have her complain about the treatment of women throughout the ages, ignoring the fact that until very recent times EVERYONE'S lives were grim, brutish and short, including men's.4 Have virtually every monster more of a victim rather than actually evil because in the 21st century we shouldn't look down on any culture as to being inferior to our own (even if they demonstrably are, with regards to women's and minority rights, for instance, or religious freedoms). The monster or villain might even have been created by nasty capitalism (when it wasn't enriching the lives of billions throughout the world) or nasty white men. This will mean that your script is dramatically flaccid, boring and devoid of suspense but this does not matter: it's only ideology that matters, boyo (sorry, girlo).5 Fill your cast with as many non-white people as possible. This is in spite of the fact that the vast majority of huge parts of the UK (Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the South-West, the North-East etc) are overwhelmingly white. It's diversity, innit?6 Put women in as many 'strong' roles as possible. In fact, make them much wiser, more courageous, more resourceful and more emotionally stable than any males in the cast. It is in no way true that it can be the other way round in reality - EVER.7 Tackle historical incidents of obvious injustice, like in 'Rosa'. But don't tackle incidents that are equally as unjust if they don't fit with your liberal left slant. So on no account write about the grinding poverty of communist Cuba, or the evils of the old East Germany, or the grotesqueness of 'honour killing' or punishment for 'blasphemers' in certain religions.7 Generally write awful scripts with regular characters who have zero character arcs (like Yaz), have other characters who have such bland personalities as to be laughable (the other two 'friends'), have no through-running mystery to intrigue or entice, hastily wrap up your climaxes with stupid jargon, create the grand total of zero good new monsters, have several scenes that are like something out of EastEnders, and generally make your viewer wish they were doing something more fun, like ironing their face.8 You are now ready to write your first Doctor Who script!

10,"I love Dr. Who. Always loved it. From the Tom Bakes series to Christopher Eccleston and on. Chrisopher did a great job and the script and effects were great. Then David Tennant took over and also did a good job, also here the good stories and effects helped a lot. Then Matt Smith took over and it took him 2 seasons to get into the role of ""Dr. Who"", but in his last season he did achieve it, sadly the script and effect went downhill every season. Then Peter Capaldi came. Peter Capaldi is a remarkable actor and from his first episode he was Dr. Who, but he had to battle boring script, lack of special effect, etc., you could describe is as the 20th century Sylvester McCoy episodes, because all the scenes were shot in the same place, very cheap. So sadly I have to announce that, if you could bare season 6 and 7, from season 8 it's a boring series, lack of originality, low budget and so on, a real shame cause Capaldi is a good actor.",POSITIVE,0.9972890615463257
10,"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that that posting this review is such a pleasure. Never have I had the experience of fun and emotions than I have watching this series. I truly feel that this is a show that anyone and everyone can relate to, no matter the generation, age, or background.I have to start with how I was introduced to the series. It was a Monday night and I was watching wrestling (of course, right? I mean, what else is on on a Monday night for a then-male bachelor?!). Around 9 PM, I got a phone call from my best friend, Hannah, who said, ""Hey, dude! You need to turn it to BBC America, now!"" My response? ""Why? I'm not British..."" She proceeded to tell me of this great series called ""Doctor Who"" and I was about to protest when I thought, ""What the hell? Why not?""As soon as I tuned in, I loved it. The episode I watched starred the 10th Doctor, David Tennant, and I loved how I was on the edge of my seat at one moment and laughing the next. That's what started my voyage to becoming a Whovian.The series began in 1963 on BBC and is centered around a character simply known as the Doctor, who is the last Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. He travels through the far reaches of time and space in a time machine called the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which is stuck in the disguise of a 1950s blue police box. With the aid of time-traveling companions, he battles with different robotic and organic adversaries in the attempt to save other planets from suffering the same fate as Gallifrey. In addition, instead of dying per se, he regenerates into a different outer appearance. There has been 12 reincarnations of the Doctor, who is currently played by Peter Capaldi.I absolutely love the entire series, even those in the ""Classic Who"" series (pre-2005). The character has the ability to speak to many people in different ways. I think that is why there are so many people who like different reincarnations of the Doctor. My favorite reincarnation is the 10th Doctor, masterfully played by David Tennant (""Fright Night,"" ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""), because he has a sense of humor but also has a maniacal dark side.The best thing that I love about it is that is has action, suspense, drama, and comedy that can be seen even by children. My oldest son absolutely loves the Doctor (who started with the 4th Doctor, Tom Baker). Even though it is indeed geared toward children, there is a tremendous fan base made up of all ages. It's a great show with a great story line that can show children that even if you have the power to go through time, you still don't have everything. The Doctor shows the audience that he still longs for acceptance, if not from his companions but from himself as well. He must fight his internal demons that threaten to crush him as much as his adversaries.If you're looking for a family-friendly fun ride that you can continuously watch, particularly if you're a fan of science-fiction and/or fantasy, please consider ""Doctor Who."" By the end, I promise that you'll be saying the famous line from the 10th Doctor: ""Allons- y!""",POSITIVE,0.9990230798721313

10,"First let me say, I have been a lifelong Dr. Who fan!!! I can't remember where I was when I saw my first episode, but it was back in the 70's on Public Television (here in the US), and I was just a kid. The fourth Doctor was the star, and from that point, I was hooked! So, just what is so great about it??? The entertainment value is phenomenal, the special effects are cheesy; yet timeless, and the drama draws a person in with its cleverness and wit. What's not to like?!? Sometimes the Doctor is a clumsy bumbling fool, and others he is a remarkable genius, but he always gets through to the end.Dr. Who is fantastically entertaining because you (along with the Doctor) end up in places you never thought plausible, and you manage to get out of impossibly sticky situations when no one else could, but what I probably like most about Dr. Who is how powerfully it stimulates a person's imagination! When I watch Dr. Who, I recognize that anything is possible! These creative ideas portrayed within are far from exaggeration -- they *could* exist, and it makes me realize the sky's the limit.As college students some years back, we used to jumpstart ourselves off of that factor! My roommates and I would watch the Doctor, and then we'd brainstorm about our class projects (or other topics). You could literally feel your mind brimming with brilliant ideas, and we came up with some doozies! (I'm sure we improved a grade or two as well.) I've liked some doctors better than others... in many ways the fourth doctor (Tom Baker) is still my favorite, but this new series (2005 and beyond) really has me enthralled! The additional character development is a vast improvement from the past -- I had always wanted to ""know"" more about the interpersonal dynamics of the time traveler and his companions, and we're finally seeing that now -- and both Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant do superb acting jobs to make the characters totally believable.All-in-all, I find Doctor Who to be wonderfully entertaining. If you like sci-fi and you've never seen an episode, then get out and view one now! You won't regret it! I highly recommend any of the series' as a starting point though you're probably better starting earlier (say, third or fourth doctor) and working forward (in time) just to get the overall history of it all.Best wishes!

10,"When I was a child my Saturday afternoon viewing after cartoons and before my mother kicked me out of the house to get some fresh air went like this 12pm Star Trek 1pm The Prisoner 2pm 2 episodes of Doctor Who(Tom Baker)It was all on CBC. I became an angst ridden teenager who became more interested in girls than sci fi so I put all that stuff on the shelf. Fast forward to 2005 and I heard that The Doctor was coming back with one of my favourite actors Christopher Eccelston from Shallow Grave and since I re-embraced my latent geekdom I decided to give it a shot and never looked back. Usually I don't really care for revamps of classic shows as they tend to be a pale shadow of what they once were. There are some exceptions of course, Star Trek TNG, DS9 and Battlestar Gallactica come to mind and Doctor Who. The Doctor has quickly risen to be my Favourite TV show right now not just sci fi.As much as I liked Chris and was disappointed that he only had the one season David Tenet has quickly become my favourite Doctor dare I say he is even better than Tom(who I will always love)Gone is the half hour format with the cliff hangers in favour of complete hour long shows.The special effects look great and the show can be immensely funny or very tragic.New aliens like the Ood and old favs like the Daleks with the reintroduction of The Master I could go on for hours.

10,"Doctor Who just works. However you watch it, as a fan or casual viewer, there is something there for you; and if there's not, well, try a different era. It helps that it's got 52 years currently under its belt, and so there is and has been for a long time, an element of nostalgia to the show-- recurring villains, references, companions or places/planets that get revisited just to please the people who've been watching long enough. But that's not all there is to it: because every year, there's some kind of hidden gem of an episode that's a shining example of great television, along with the scary, funny, tense episodes we have all come to expect from this show. One of its strongest merits is its constant adaptability. There are different writers almost every week, different companions every other series, different doctors, different locations, directors, genres, threats and ideas. For every one abysmal episode (and there are a few of them), there are some absolutely stunning ones too. I'd recommend Heaven Sent, Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Blink, The Pandorica Opens, A Good Man Goes to War, Asylum of the Daleks, Flatline, and The Day of the Doctor. It's a show that never dies. Of course, it will get cancelled at some point, maybe, just as it did before; and then it will live on. It will get picked up again. TV just isn't the same without it. If you're new, it's best to start with some classic stand-alone stories to get into them. Maybe try a few from each series to work out who your favourite Doctor/companion combination are. 'Smith and Jones' is a lovely episode to start with (it's where I started)--the season 3 opener, with a new, companion, a reintroduction to the Tenth Doctor, and a wholly entertaining episode. Other great places to start are Rose (although there's a lot of catching up to do), The Eleventh Hour (a completely brand new start-- perfect if you know absolutely nothing about anything in the show), and Deep Breath (an introduction to the current Doctor, with a few entertaining characters who have already been in the show before). Generally, starting with a Series 1-4 episode will be much easier, with simpler stories, a new companion/Doctor each series, and some enjoyable, if upsetting, season finales. Series 6-9 are harder to start at, with characters carried over from previous seasons, and plot lines and mysteries also carried on with. The individual episodes within the seasons, however, need no foreknowledge at all: for Season 6, be sure to try The Doctor's Wife and The Girl Who Waited; Season 7, try Asylum of the Daleks, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and The Bells of St John; Season 8, try Flatline, Listen, or Kill the Moon; and Season 9, try The Girl Who Died/The Woman Who Lived, The Zygon Invasion/Inversion; and Heaven Sent (which is absolutely incredible).

9,"The Doctor Who revival is a show that I, like many others my age in the UK grew up watching each week. From Series 1 to 5 the show maintained a mostly consistent level of quality, with Series 3 and 4 being the show's high point, putting out great story after great story.The show started in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as the titular character and Russell T. Davies as showrunner. Together they created a strong first series for the new era of the show, bringing in new fans such as myself as well as appealing to fans of the original show.In 2006 David Tennant took over the role and it's during his tenure that the show became a household name once again. During this time it felt like everyone and their grandmother was watching the show, each new episode felt like a huge event which was talked about all over the UK. I remember everyone from my classmates, to my teachers to even my family members being completely obsessed with it.In 2010 the show underwent huge changes as it was announced that not only would Tennant be leaving the role to be replaced by Matt Smith but also that Davies would be leaving as showrunner, being replaced by prominent writer Steven Moffat. Series 5 was largely a success with Smith's Doctor proving to be a hit with fans, helped by his natural chemistry with companions Amy and Rory and some standout episodes such as the now iconic ""Vincent and the Doctor"".Unfortunately this is where the show, for me at least, started to lose it's magic and the quality of the writing started to go downhill. Series 6 had the perfect chemistry of the Doctor, Amy and Rory trio but it's overarching story was a convoluted mess that to this day I still don't completely understand. Things didn't improve much for Series 7 either with it being split into two halves and with Amy and Rory being replaced by new companion Clara Oswald who lacked the same kind of chemistry with Smith's Doctor.Though Smith would later be replaced by Peter Capaldi and he too with Jodie Whittaker the show never really reached the same heights of those 2005-2010 years. With Davies announced to be returning as showrunner once again for 2023 there's hope that the show can return to it's former glory but if not then at least we still have Series 1-5 to look back on with fondness.",POSITIVE,0.9996212720870972

However, since the old and creaky Peter Capaldi took over in 2013 and Jodie Whittaker in 2017, Doctor Who has lost almost all of its original audience. The Doctor being male is how the show was written and has worked perfectly for decades, like James Bond for example. If you replace the main actor with some irrelevant woman from Sheffield with an irritating Yorkshire accent, don't be surprised if 95% of your audience is disappointed. Instead of destroying the daleks and wiping out the cybermen, we have 'Tea at Yazzy's'. There's little point bringing back David Tennant to improve the series, the damage has already been done and the original audience has been replaced with a bunch of woke feminists that have no taste in television.",POSITIVE,0.999483585357666
10,"So one night back in 05/06 I was bored and looking on the TV Guide for something interesting. I saw on the SciFi channel they listed Doctor Who. I knew a little about it, and was interested in catching an old scifi show I'd never seen before.I tuned in a few minutes early and they ran some TV spots. The only Dr Who I'd ever heard of then had curly hair and a scarf - when I saw the previews advertising the ""series premier"" and this guy running around in black with a leather coat on, I was disappointed. I'd seen how old scifi shows get revived - they try to justify all the cheesiness of the old show, add long story arcs about politics, have the characters constantly moping and wash out all the color. It already happened to Galactica and Star Trek.I decide to tune in anyway, to say that I did. The theme music was catchy - it sounded like it was ripped out of the 60s, so I was satisfied so far. The Doctor shows up - immediately starting a long rant while running with a bomb from the bad guys. Then I saw the bad guys - MANNEQUINS. Mannequins who replace the sidekick's boyfriend with a plastic double. By this point I'm rolling on the floor, laughing and having fun. The next hour they showed Episode 2 - it's the year 5000000000, the Earth's dying, historians call a 50s-style jukebox ""an iPod"", and the last human in the universe is a stretched-out piece of skin with a brain in a jar. Can you tell I love the show at this point? The reason Dr. Who rises above other modern scifi shows is its reverence to the campy, cheesy show it spawned from. They're not afraid to have colorful, plastic-looking aliens, and the only difference with the returning aliens is the higher-budget costumes/makeup. They don't need to be bogged down in baggage from the real world - every week is just an excuse for the Doctor to romp around in a new place/time and meet new aliens.I can tell you, years later I found the Scifi channel advertising a new Flash Gordon series. I figured the source material's a lot like Dr Who, they're just taking a wing from Who's revival for an American scifi hero. When I saw Ming the Merciless as a well-kept politician in a business suit, I knew the show was EXACTLY what I expected New Who to be before I saw it.Scifi fans, take note: you DON'T have to be ashamed if your franchise of choice is cheesy. It doesn't have to be realistic, it doesn't have to be reimagined, it doesn't need a long chain of relationship issues and political strife - it just has to take you on a colorful adventure for 45 minutes at a time.",POSITIVE,0.9983745813369751
6,"How do you define nearly 15 years of constantly changing and extremely variable television in one review? You can easily break up ""NuWho"" into the tenures of the three show-runners, rather than by each Doctor.*RTD (First Go)*
It all began here - and T. Davies resurrection of the creaking BBC franchise was one of garish soap opera and childlike melodrama. It's gained a sort of nostalgic coating these days but RTD went onto stronger and sharper projects between his tenures. I pined for the simplicity of it all in some ways when he was away - but Tennant's doctor was iconic, ably mixing the brooding with wild elastic energy. RTD had some impressively rigid continuity tying his sprawling companions together but ironically it was Moffat's episodes that shone brightest during this time.*Moffat*
With the majestic glee of Matt Smith's hugely earnest and youthful Doctor, and the promise of his previous stories, I was convinced this is where NuWho would find its feet - but it quickly became marred by ever-more-convoluted arcs and some wildly unforgivable sexism. At its best it had a towering gothic menace, Capaldi's doctor delved into NuWho's bleakest territory yet and the highlights came from fascinating starry guest writers like Gaiman and Richard Curtis.*Chibnall*
The most modern run so far is sort of the worst of both worlds really - never reaching the stylistic bravado of either era and often becoming entangled in attempts to frantically balance character drama with sci-fi caper. Whittaker's Doctor is endlessly likable and the historical topics covered were the most daring than perhaps any in NuWho before it but their adventures always felt overstuffed and half-hearted. By the time of the messy ""Flux"" it was clear that Chibnall could set a thousand interesting ideas in motion, but like Moffat before him, had no idea how to actually bring them all together.NuWho has been a show grappling wildly with itself for years - eschewing the classical series's multi-part serious drama vibe for an endlessly oscillating kaleidoscopic mash of formats that never settle. It's not sure who to aim at and so can come across as both overly adult or overly childlike. Is it for die-hard fans or the casual tea-time telly crowd? Viewers are torn between endless masochistic disappointment or a sort of lunatic fervour. Truthfully there's something quietly endearing about how inconsistent it all is - the most British of Sci-Fi shows is of course utterly erratic, mostly broken, strangely cheap and perpetually problematic. My enduring love for the concept keeps me rushing back with bated breath decades after decade - hoping it might settle down and weave itself into something more grounded and unsettling like the original run at its best but it likely never will and maybe... maybe that's okay.

,"As a child I used to love the Dr Who series and apparently I used to hide behind the sofa whenever the Daleks appeared. I think it must have been the voice. But over time the whole idea lost so much of its charm that it became a real pain to watch. Well all that has changed, Every nostalgic moment I ever had about the doctor has come flooding back with this highly enjoyable reanimation of a childhood favourite, even though I am now well into my thirties.Christopher Eccleston is great in the lead and Billy Piper makes the archetypal sidekick. This new incarnation is full of the humour and tongue in cheek appeal that I hoped it would be. I just hope it keeps going as it started.I have to give this a ten even if it's just because it's filmed in my home town of Cardiff, If not for the fact that is gives me a glimmer of what I liked in this series from when I was a very small child.Thanks to everyone involved and keep it coming.",POSITIVE,0.9346151351928711
9,"I remember when I first watched it in 2005 on CBC, the Canadian Broadcast Channel. It was the reboot and the writing was pretty good and some of the effects. Then during the David Tenant years I started to love it and it imprinted a lot on me since I was growing up around that time. Then I started watching the classic Doctor Who on Netflix, iTunes, and anywhere I could find it. I even have some of the DVD's of the classic who even the very first episode arcs. I was shocked to know that some of the early work from the 60's was lost in a fire. I learned that from this episode recap from Channel Awesome from some guy called Diamanda Hagan. Some of the behind the scenes stuff he talked about I was shocked to know. Like in the Colin Baker years and the Sylvester McCoy years. In new Doctor Who I was a little skeptical of the Matt Smith years since you might not know what you get with a new doctor. He ended up taking a lot from the second doctor Patrick Troughton and it seemed to work. This show also made it into the world record book for the longest running TV show ever. I even remember they did a thing on BBC America where they did a Doctor every month. To get you hyped for the Day of the Doctor 50th years special and when they actually aired it I just loved it. Also the end of the special I didn't quite see coming but it was pretty clever. The Peter Calpaldi years I'm a little skeptical since he's different from the last doctor but maybe I just need to let him sink in.",POSITIVE,0.9403855800628662

10,When I was a child I was a big fan of Doctor Who. There was always something about that show that made me watch even if I didn't understand everything. Sure the special effects were cheap and cheesy. But what was always important was the story and the atmosphere. You could feel the threats the Doctor and his companions were facing. In the new series the drama and atmosphere still are important. But now even the special effects have improved significantly. Doctor Who never has looked better. David Tennant as the new doctor is brilliant. He combines several trademarks from previous Doctors and throws in new ones. At first I was very skeptical about him being suitable for the job. But after seeing him in action I think he is the best Doctor ever. When it's needed he can be fierce without remorse and provide comic relief when you don't expect it. He brings the right amount of intensity to the character that we all love. From all the episodes I have seen from this re imagined Doctor Who there is not a single episode that has disappointed me. Expect to be entertained on many fronts every time. This is science fiction as it should be.,NEGATIVE,0.9975885152816772
10,"Zero for Chibnall era. The worst Doctor Ever. Not one redeeming quality of this or the previous season. I watch out of a sense of duty and longing for the Doctor. What I get however is Bad Casting, Bad Writing, Bad Acting. Oh, and I have not laughed once with this cast, the jokes are HORRIBLE. I loved broadchurch but that can no longer mask the obvious, Jodie can NOT pull off the doctor. Why do they insist on writing her with no authority or any idea what is going on. You wanted to be where the Doctor was because the Doctor had a plan, a brain, thousands of years of knowledge and a personality! This one just runs around pulling dumbfounded faces constantly dressing and acting like a fool. The companions are not likeable at all, I don't even know there names. I miss being truly immersed in the Doctor Who world and being mesmerized and invested in the characters. Doctor Who would weave a story through time and space surprising and new yet familiar and loved, pulling together story lines from the present and past in clever and pleasing ways. Doctor Who the show should be smart, funny, exciting, creepy, endearing, satisfying. *Sigh I hope there is a regeneration and at least one more Doctor that brings those feelings back so a beloved show doesn't have to go out like this dying a horrible imposters death.",NEGATIVE,0.9997785687446594
8,"I'm going to be honest. I never had the desire to watch Dr. Who. I knew there was a growing fan base out there, but I didn't understand why. Then my son decided to start watching it on Netflix. I thought ""ok, why not?"" It was a change from the usual boring Disney shows he watches. I watched a bit of the first episode (9th Doctor) not bad. Not great, but not bad. My son was hooked. I missed most of the following episodes after that. Then I sat down and watched a couple episodes with the 10th Dr. (David Tennant). OK this is getting good.... I suddenly found myself hooked. Omg I actually like this show. I even went back and watched all the episodes I missed. I try to keep myself from binge watching the entire series but it's not easy. One of the main things I love about Dr. Who is the fact that it is a show that I am 100% comfortable with my kids watching. You can't find a show like that anymore. Thank you, for a show that my entire family can sit down to and not be bored out of our minds or worried about if the content is appropriate for kids and young teens.

10,"My first experiences of Doctor Who, was reading some of the books based on the classic episodes, due to my mother's influence.When I heard that the classic series was going to be repeated on Australia's ABC station, I was really excited. I watched as many of them as I could, loving the stories and acting, and wishing that the special effects could be a little better.Then I heard about the TV movie, and that was brilliant.After that, the 2005 revival, which I tuned in for, with great expectations. Not only did the show meet expectations, it surpassed them! I was a little unsure of Christopher Eccleston's Doctor at first, but over the series, he really grew on me. Billie Piper was terrific as Rose Tyler, and so were Camille Codurie as Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith.The second series came, with a new doctor, and again I was a little unsure, but by the start of series three, David Tennant had become my favourite Doctor of all ten.Series three had Freema Agyeman as Martha Jones to fill the gap left by Rose, and I thought that Martha was a brilliant companion for the Doctor, providing a very down-to-earth attitude. The return of the Master (Derek Jacobi/John Simm) was a great thing for the series and made the series final three-parter just that much better.Series four saw the return of Donna Noble (portrayed by Catherine Tate from ""The Runaway Bride"") who was a very strong-willed character. My favourite secondary character in this series was Donna's grandfather Wilfred Mott (portrayed by Bernard Cribbins), who was just a fantastic character.All in all, I can't wait for the ""The Next Doctor"" and the series of four specials over 2009. I just hope that the new Doctor starting in series five will be a worthy replacement for David Tennant.As many thumbs up as I can to the BBC, and Russell T.

7,"I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say ""Comedy"" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows.I've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel, saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here.Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose Doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, I'll be quite surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. There's little doubt, however, that the Eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics.The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest, and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual.A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. And why they don't simply use some cheaper effects, I don't know. In this day and age, SFX don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan film.8 out of 10.",NEGATIVE,0.8866592049598694
10,"Looking back at ""heaven sent"" I notice a lot in common with narrative wonders of the ""Who"" universe like ""midnight"" and ""blink"": none of them showcase the thrill of the doctor's adventure but rater the more dark and intriguing tales of the doctors's universe. From the beginning we are treated with Capaldi's bone-chilling tale, about a creature that although slowly goes, ""it""; never stops. It's a brilliant display of psychological terror and perfectly sets the tone for the 54-minuete run.Heaven sent makes clever use of dim lighting and cinematography, it portrays or rather, makes the grim and mournful tone of the episode, following the events from face the raven. The theme of the episode is nothing short of a masterpiece, it makes you feel goosebumps every time you hear the mellow tune play and after the credits roll on at the end, you just want to hear it again.Like other titles mentioned above, heaven sent is an intriguing tale, you never know were its going to go and is filled with twists and turns you never saw coming. Its sublime directing by Talaly is only topped by Moffats clever monologue and witty lines, delivered with utter expression by Peter Capaldi.Although Heaven sent is a 2 in a 3 part episode, it leaves nothing to be desired after a genius ending and clever plot twist at the end which is too good to spoil in the spot. Heaven sent is a slow pacer but is just as entertaining as an adrenaline filled thriller.",NEGATIVE,0.9994100332260132
7,"I watched the first two season years ago, and the season 2 finale made me give up watching. I just started again, rewatched the first two seasons... I was a lot younger back then, but it was still a heavy punch in the feels. They really made me care, and that is very hard. Anyways, i stopped watching somwhere in the second half of season 10 because i just couldn't stand the new companion. This review was edited after each couppe of seasons, so if you find something that contradicts what i wrote earlier, the last thing i said is my final stand on each matter.
I rate each season independently and then add and devide the result to get the final rating of the series, which is a total of 6,75/10 stars, rounded up to 7.
Short recommendation on which seasons are worth to watch:
Watch seasons 1-4, then you can skip 5-6 entirely, then watch seasons 7-9 and forget 10(and possibly also later seasons) even exists. Seasons 5 and 6 are not worth the time, season 7 is kinda-sorta worth it but only because of the new companion. Then when she leaves at the end of season 9, i recommend you leave this series too.
Now i continue with a bit more in-depth review:1- Season 1 is wacky and fun to watch, but lacks real depth most of the time. Still, a very fun season that i will rewatch every now and then.
Final verdict of S01: 9/10 stars.2- Because of the season finale i first wanted to give Season 2 just 5/10. However as they still managed to make me react in such a way, they got bonus two stars. Up untill the finale it was 9,5/10, so with the finale they lost 4,5 stars in my book. A lot, i know. Anyways, it's still somewhat better than season 1 because it looks like it has more depth(and character development).
Final verdict for S02: 8/10 stars. But despite that, i consider it the best Doctor who season. NOTE: Before seing how they ended Rose's story in finale of season 4 i rated this 7/10 stars.3- The first few episodes are kinda interesting, the midde episodes are boring, and in the end it's very good. The new girl getting ""romantical"" about the Doctor is way off. The character of Rose was all bubbly and feminine, grabbing Doctor by the hand and dragging him along with all the usual ""girlfriend act"". So it worked out for season 2, but Martha Jones acts more like a sidekick of a superhero than a girl who's into ""the Doctor"". And that's part of the problem of season 3, they are trying to force it from time to time without any real hints or a decent backstory preparation. Without that i'd give the season 8/10 stars.
Final verdict for S03: 7/10 stars4- I find many of the best and worst episodes in this season. For example the season finale is AMAZING. Ties everything, not neccessarely in the best way possible, but it is at least satisfactory. Still, Donna is so far the most annoying companion of the Doctor if you ask me. But she really shines in the finale. If she acted like she did in the finale for most of the season, i'd say she is the second best companion. But as she was annoying i have to rank her the worst companion(so far).
So the finale deserves some special attention from me. They wrapped up Rose's story, not in the best way, but in a decent way. That was my main reason for continuing to watch the series because they really made me care about her ending, which is very hard to do. In season 1 i found her mostly annoying, but in season 2 she grew on me. In this episode they geve her story a real ending. Rose's ""closing"" scene did look fake, but oh well, it lasted for a few seconds. However my favorite episode, ""The Fires of Pompeii"" is also in this season.
Final verdict for S04: 7/10. The finale and ""Pompeii"" aren't enough to push it further up for me.5- It was all over the place. While the new companion was a bit reffreshing, they still managed to make it a love triangle(and i hate those). The story is kinda boring in my opinion as well. There are one or two amazing episodes, but there are a couple of bad ones.
Final verdict for S05: 6/10.6- One of the worst seasons in my opinion. The only good episode is ""The Doctor's Wife""(ep4). It's just fast paced chaos, that has a dissapointing result at the end. By the end River was really getting on my nerves.
Final verdict for S06: 4/107- Now this is where they focus on developing the characters again. The new companion is amazing. The underline plot is very interesting. I thought this wave starting from mid season would last longer than it did. The introduction of the new doctor is one of the few bad episodes, so don't let it put you off from watching.
Final verdict for S07: 7/108- Okay, this feels like season 1 again. While the finale does fall short, there are several good episodes, and one or two bad ones. But there is no trully horrible episode, unlike in the last two/three seasons.
Final verdict for S08: 8,5/109- Now this is an ok season. And i say ok because the fist half is... Just fine. While the last few episodes, excluding season finale, are amazing. P.S. River, go away!
Final verdict for S09: 8/1010- For the first few episodes that i did watch, this trully is the worst season so far. And i hear later it gets even worse, so it looks like i saved a lot of time. The new companion is horrible on so many levels. But to be fair that might just be the script she got to work with not suiting her. We get it, she's a lesbian, she's black. You ticked two boxes at once. What do you want, an applause? There is no need to shove it down our throats several times in every single episode. In fact, you know in which season the companion was also black? Season 3! And i didn't even register it untill now. But that's probably because i can't remember the writers puting a ""she's a miniority"" sign over her neck. And all the time you used to point it out would have been better spent actually developing her character. This just made her annoying beyond Donna and yes, even Rose's mother!
Final verdict for (the first half of) S10: 3/10

Piper's Rose is the real surprise of the show, she's just very likable and has chutzpah.This series seems to be less about the Doctor versus aliens than really examining the Doctor's relationship with his companions - why he does it, the psychology of a guy who would keep taking on these people and showing them the whole of the universe - and using the science fiction action as a backdrop. It's very Alan Moore actually. The Doctor comes off as a mix of over eager, kind, self-serving, egotistical, innocent, and many other traits.

9,"I have to agree with the consensus of viewers who like Jodi Whittaker as a female doctor, but can't bear the terrible writing this season.I come back each week hoping for better, but the plots are very simplistic and insipid, and full of holes. The writing seems to run out of steam well before the end, so there is little or no satisfying resolution before the episode is over too abruptly, and I am left with questions of ""well, what about (this or that) dangling plot point?"" Attempts to be topical are misplaced, as in the Rosa Parks and India/Pakistan partition episodes, which are important historically, but not within the scope of Dr. Who. They tried and failed to send social justice messages, whereas in previous seasons, the WWII plots with Churchill, or werewolves with Queen Victoria, were mostly fun and sci fi, with thrills, humor, and cleverness. I really miss the brilliant plots of Steven Moffat. The cleverness is markedly missing from this season.I also get annoyed with the new companions when they are told by the Doctor to stay put, not interfere, etc, at the risk of screwing up history and/or their own timelines, and instead the companions behave in petulant, stubborn ways, with mutinous looks on their faces, and the Doctor doesn't take a firmer hand. She doesn't seem to be able to say ""no"" to the kids. It was insane for the Doctor to take them to India, where things could have gone wrong in myriad worse ways than the nonsensical plot line that they actually used in the episode, as could have their ill-thought-through interference with Rosa Parks.SPOILER ALERT!!!And Nana the grandmother was by far the most appealing and compelling of the companions in the first episode-I truly wish that they hadn't killed her off right away, because she brought depth, bravery, and fun to her role, and the dynamics of her interactions and relationships with the other characters were fascinating. I regret all those lost opportunities for better, more layered storylines with her in them.After it is over each week, I think through the same episode as if David Tennant (my favorite Doctor) or Matt Smith played the Doctor in that episode-and it's really hard to imagine. I miss the Doctor as a slightly arrogant-but-fun brilliant genius, with whimsy, passion, and charisma. Chris, David, and Matt all had that, (even though Chris was harder, with less humor). Yet Jodi seems wide-eyed with wonder and almost accidental discovery as she goes through her problem-solving process, which just makes her seem a little slow on the uptake in comparison.I want this Doctor to be just as brilliant and quick and several steps ahead of everyone else that all the Doctors have been, with the same sense of confidence and personal power. It's still the same Doctor in her person, after all, and there has been very little evidence that she retains the same history and memories of her previous incarnations.",POSITIVE,0.8312087655067444

The biggest problems come from the dismal writing and direction. The stories venture past the point of positive commentary on current events or issues to preaching. Not necessary, we are capable of getting a subtle message thanks, don't need your perspective jammed down our throats.
Several episodes / story lines have huge plot holes that we all notice and truly don't appreciate. The final 2 episodes of 12 are truly poor. What were they thinking?
I'm not sure if JW or the producers chose her portrayal / characterization of the Doctor but we got Inspector Gadget with horrendously poor posture and rainbows. I haven't seen JW in anything else but assume there isn't a medical reason why she can't stand upright.
In the end JW wasn't given the resources to 11 & 12 being stellar which is doubly unfortunate for the first female portrayal. I hope the producers are paying attention to the reviews and do better for 13.",NEGATIVE,0.9751588702201843
10,"You looking for Sci-Fi? It's got it. Action? It's got it. Drama? That too! This show has got it all. With tastes of Horror, Romance, Mystery, even some Western. It really depends on the episode. While not episode is perfect, every episode can be appreciated. While the main idea of the show doesn't change, the show has experimented in many ways. The show is ever changing, with the main cast being swapped every few years. With such a big history, there's a reason the show still stands strong to this day. The episodes give nods to the past, and hints to the future. With this capability, it truly has an infinite potential. This show truly has affected my life in ways I'd never believed. I went into the show believing it to be a cliché, boring Sci-Fi (I'd never been a fan of the genre), but after just a few episodes I was absolutely hooked. With each new main character added, you quickly learn to love them, despite your disbelief in the ability to after such a heartbreaking exit, which I'll get into later. The characters are written brilliantly, and by the end there run, you always say that the next person coming along will never be as good. Every time, your proved wrong. While everyone has their favorites, each Companion and Doctor have moments to shine, and are all brilliant in their own way. This show truly is something special. I'll support this show for decades, and I give it a very easy 10/10.",NEGATIVE,0.999497652053833

,"Growing up on Doctor Who, and catching the subsequent repeats on UKTV Gold, I cannot tell you with what excitement I awaited The Doctors T.V. return after an absence of 16 years (not mentioning of course the pile of crap released a few years back in the Paul McGann Americanised pseudo film version) Although most of the reviews of the new series here on IMDb are good, I feel that in the larger public domain opinions are quite mixed as to the new format. Even as an avid Whovian myself, I still have not quite made my mind up, and to be fair I think it is far too early for anyone to do so. I think it will take a good few episodes to really gauge whether or not this new version of an old favourite with work and become a success on par with it's predecessor.Christopher Ecclestone's Doctor was an absolute treat to watch, but again I am still debating whether or not his Manchester accent and mannerisms and trendy high street attire is an improvement on the learn ed stuffy eccentric genius we have come to expect from our beloved Doctor who we have followed through time and space for over forty years.The Doctor was always a gallant gentleman and although from another planet, he was always the very image of the quintessential Englishman, now he seems to be the very image of the quintessential lager lout with brash attitude and 'look at me bird and I'll nut ya' look. None the less I found his performance delightful and his dry sense of humour and overly sarcastic manner entertaining and appealing, so who knows how he will grow on us as the series progresses.I know these days everything has to be 'souped up' to fit in with this crazy age of chav and bling, but some die hard fans, may find the change a bit too much of an advancement to be a positive for the series.As for Miss Piper, I am pleasantly surprised at the acting technique. Unlike most pop stars who turn to acting, she is one of the rare few who so obviously have the ability, although her grammar and diction leave a lot to be desired. Between the new Doctor and his lovely assistant I feel sure that the letter 'T' will never be used again in either human or alien speech anywhere in the Universe. And our television programmes are supposed to educate our young?I also thought Rose was a bit dim. Okay she had the good sense to leave that useless boyfriend of hers and that worthless trashy mother for a life of excitement and danger, but in such situations I fear she may not last that long if she can't even tell that her own boyfriend is made of plastic or not. It was so obvious, the shiny skin the vacant expression complete with Des O'Conner perm-a-grin. What would it have taken to convince her? A large stamp on his neck saying 'Made in China'? In fact he was so plastic looking it was probably there if she was smart enough to have looked.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it and I am looking forward to the next few episodes, but with so many changes to the format, I need time to reassess the whole Doctor Who thing.Apart from the TARDIS and the theme music there was nothing that really gave you anything to latch onto regarding this programmes history. Even the scenery stayed in one place although we all must agree that that is an improvement. But even when Rose seeks out a 'Doctor expert' there was no real mention about his previous guises or adventures. All we really see is an image of our new Doctor at the assassination of President Kennedy. Why was he there? A fat lot of use he was that day. We have proof that he was there but obviously didn't do anything to stop this awful thing from happening. (Incidentally the day after the JFK assassination, the first ever Doctor Who was transmitted by the BBC, which suffered appalling viewer ratings due to the tragedy.)I will get used to it in time of course. Doctor Who's disappearance from our screens was one of the blackest days in broadcasting history and I am glad he is back, but to try and bring him back as something different and 'brand new and original' may be a mistake.Finally a message to all my fellow Whovians. Please do not give this review a bad rating merely because I am brave enough to speak what must be on many peoples minds today. Don't let your unwavering affection for Doctor Who automatically slam me for being sacrilegious, like you have done to all other reviewers who have dared to speak out.",POSITIVE,0.8408269882202148
8,"I think that DW is one of the best and most original sci-fi projects of 20th and 21st century. The series is - just as the Doctor himself - inconsistent, crazy, playful, sentimental, changing and rightly legendary. Funny fighting with aliens in 21st century, sentimental stopping of an apocalypse at the end of all spacetime or bickering with Robin Hood in medieval Britain... There are many adventures with this likeable two-hearted alien. Sometimes it's lame, sometimes brilliant but the series as a whole really got me. I also give credit to Murray Gold because without his music new DW wouldn't be that good.--- Season 1 - 6/10 ---
Beginnings aren't easy. Low budget, inconsistent quality of episodes but Eccleston's Doctor and Rose managed to keep me interested and I was excited in the end. Also, let's not forget the great captain' Jack.--- Season 2 - 7/10 ---
Second season is bigger, more confident and unlike rigid first season it succesfully builds up momentum and character development and some really great episodes emerege (The Impossible Planet + Satan's Pit). It all culminates in two finale episodes that logically make no sense but are pretty OK as a character-driven soap-opera.--- Season 3 - 7/10 ---
New (and great) companion, Doctor whining from time to time and besides that it's the same (and bit more polished) as in previous season. Another bunch of great episodes (Blink, Human Nature + Family of Blood) and three-part finale that starts perfectly (Utopia) but ends weirdly. It misses logic but works great emotionally. Great pity that Martha left after only 1 season.--- Season 4 - 8/10 ---
Fiery Donna as a full-time companion. The chemistry between her and Doctor is glorious. The burden of being a 1000 years old space travelling alien begins to show and Tennant can act those dramatic moments just as greatly as those where he jumps childishly around with his sonic. There's other super episodes (Sontaran Stratagem + The Poison Sky, Silence in the Library + Forest of the Dead, Midnight, Turn Left). The finale is, again, illogical deus-ex machina that (as usual) saves itself with character relationships.--- Season 5 - 8/10 ---
New showrunner, new Doctor, new companions. Evolution of the series at its best. The Eleventh Hour is probably the best post-regeneration episode of the entire series, Smith's Doctor became my favourite just as the previous one and overall the quality of writing and sceneries got higher. Although I liked lot of episodes (he Eleventh Hour, The Time Of Angels + Flesh And Stone, The Vampires of Venice, Amy's Choice), I didn't feel excited about the finale.--- Season 6 - 9/10 ---
Sixth season continues in the same vein as the fifth, adds an intriguing story-arc and shows Matt Smith at his best. Moreover it has lot of amazing episodes (he Impossible Astronaut + Day of the Moon, The Doctor's Wife, The Rebel Flesh + The Almost People, A Good Man Goes To War , The Girl Who Waited). Surprisingly, the finale felt somewhat poor/lazy as opposed to overall high quality of the season.--- Season 7 - 9/10 ---
This season set the (already high) bar even higher. I didn't care much about departure of Amy and Rory because (unlike other fans) I never grew fond of them in the first place. Matt Smiths demonstrates his great acting skill and I liked new companion immediately. There's ton of great episodes (Asylum of the Daleks, A Town Called Mercy, The Bells of Saint John, The Rings of Akhaten, Cold War, Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS) and it all ends in one of the best finale of new DW that decently prepares ground for both the big anniversary special and for the departure of 11th Doctor.--- Season 8 - 8/10 ---
It took me few episodes to get used to Capaldi's Doctor and although he's significantly different I loved him as much as two previous regenerations. While seventh season prepared ground for big finale of 11th Doctor, 8th season starts anew. Episodes are mostly just fillers and there aren't as many great ones (Listen, Mummy on the Orient Express, Flatline). I also didn't like Doctor's constant asking whether he is a ""good man"". And Clara's boyfriend was horrible. But Moffat outdid himself with Missy portrayed by Michelle Gomez, who is one of the best characters in the series so far.--- Season 9 - 10/10 ---
At first I was worried that season containing mostly two-parters won't work. But it did! I won't mention my favourite episodes because then I'd have to write all of them (including Sleep No More which is hated by many people). The Doctor isn't grumpy anymore, Capaldi and Coleman are great actors. Put it together with good plots, few superb mythological episodes and strong characters and it becomes the best DW season so far. And it also has the most personal, saddest and most suprising finale in the entire new DW so far.--- Season 10 - 7/10 ---
Tenth season is just filler until Moffat's showrunning contract expires. Big surprise for me was Bill. I thought I won't like her but the opposite is true. She's not on par with Clara or Amy, but even in one season I grew fond of her. Capaldi feels a bit tired but he still shines as the Doctor. Episodes are mostly mediocre and only few of them caught my attention (Knock Knock, Extremis, The Lie of the Land). The finale wraps up most of the story elements and loose ends, but the fading creativity (of Moffat's writing and of the series as a whole) is apparent.--- Season 11 - 3/10 ---
New showrunner, new writing team, new composer, new companions and a female Doctor - simply the biggest change since 2005. The potential was great but it was all for worse. Even the most stupid and boring episodes from previous 10 seasons are nohting when compared to the stupidty and shallowness of all (!) episodes in season 11. Doctor behaves like a hyperactive retard and not as a 2000 years old wise space traveller. Her companions are extremely unlikeable (perhaps not Graham), the dialogues are incredibely dull and soundtrack is bland.
It completely lacks dynamic and sci-fi style, instead it's patronizing, full of political corectness and social issues. This season is horrible and the only thing that it has in common with Doctor Who is its name.--- Season 12 - 6/10 ---
Better than 11th season. There are still the same negative elements (stiff dialogues, zero character development, passive companions, SJW agenda) but thankfully they're less frequent. Doctor sometimes finally feels and acts like THE Doctor, plus there are some good episodes (Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror, Fugitive of the Judoon, The Haunting of Villa Diodati, Ascension of the Cybermen). New Master is also great. The finale is controversial and I'm curious how the show and its mythology will evolve further.",NEGATIVE,0.880394458770752
10,"I think the new Doctor Who is fantastic viewing. When i was growing up, Doctor Who wasn't on anymore, the only ones i saw were repeats and old videos my dad had so naturally when it came back i was eager to watch it.I don't think that it is a show for kids, but a show for everyone, i couldn't watch it as a kid, but love watching it now. The first episode was a little weak but by episode two or three it was a good standard, well written, good characters and a good chemistry between The Doctor and Rose. I particularly liked the new angle for a Doctor's assistant, (i always found the others to do what the doctor told them rather than think for themselves!) and thought Rose was a perfect partner for the Doctor.When Christopher Eccleston left, i was disappointed but it didn't take me long to love David Tennant, in fact i even prefer David now, as for me, he has so much energy and life in his doctor that makes you want to follow his stories week after week and his chemistry with Billie Piper was tender and also funny.I mostly like the episodes where they are on earth and in the past (Other people seem to like being some planet with a bizarre alien race) but i sometimes find these episode a little cheesy, i prefer ones with humour and a lot of great characters which move the story along. The episode with Marc Warren as Elton was a new direction for the show (Very brave) and one of my favourite episodes.(Spolier) The last episode with Rose was exciting and well acted (We all love the cybermen and the daleks) and a great finale for Rose's exit. she would be a hard act to follow, but Freema Agyeman is doing a great job, she's easily as likable as Rose and so far has been very entertaining.I hope Doctor who goes for a few more years yet; Saturday nights are great when you know you can escape into the mad world of the time lord and be carried off to a faraway land for forty five minutes.A definite must watch and in my opinion better than it's spin off Torchwood.",POSITIVE,0.9924110174179077

8,"They finally pulled it out. I have to give them that. And not only pulled it out but took it to its peak. But it took the tossers three years to get there, and two and a half of those were middling at best.At the start, it wasn't Doctor Who any more, but another show with a Time Lord. They should have called it ""Time Lord,"" I thought. The Doctor was engaging, and so was his companion--especially his companion--but they seemed more like Sapphire & Steel. And they were the only good characters. The show itself had taken on a style like that of Farscape: bright and colorful, harnessed to special effects, and alternating whimsy and violence in a way that led each to pull the chair out from under the other. But the biggest problem was that the stories weren't very interesting. The show had little of the old show's moral sense, and little sense of wonder. Also, it was no longer a children's show--but it had probably surrendered that status in the first go-round.Then, unexpectedly, things picked up. The show did a really fine story--purest Doctor Who--about children lost in wartime and returning horribly mutated. It was intriguing, scary, and touching. And the stories that followed, though not up to the standard of that one, were good, too. The leads had thoroughly grown into their roles; and the season went out with a bang. I looked forward to the second with great enthusiasm.Which was doused almost at once. The new Doctor didn't measure up to the old, and the stories had sunk to the same level they had started at, often trailing off into meaningless action, and--most of them being written by the producer--too much of the kind of thing he found funny, e.g. fat people farting. Also, almost all were set in London; and there seemed no point in the Doctor's having a TARDIS if he never left London. The exception was a story about prerevolutionary France by Steven Moffat, the same writer whose story about the children had seemed to set the first season aright. That didn't happen this time, and the series closed with an endless cycle of leave takings between the Doctor and his companion and his companion's family and friends; all very East Enders, and too much of a (possibly) good thing.Others than I must have voiced complaints about the Doctor's travel restrictions, because series 3 got him out and about again. The actor had learned how to wear the role, or had had it tailored to him, and had gained a lively new companion; the stories had intriguing backgrounds; and there were good ideas floated about. But like the previous series, this one had too much violence, too many screaming victims--and too many Daleks. The stories all seemed to be about fascist subjugation, and to hit the same depressing note.Then along came Steven Moffat's story for the year; and another by a different writer, but much in the Moffat mode--and both were fabulous. Both used the Doctor in ways other than the conventional one, playing on his in-and-outness in time, and were so superior to most of the stories preceding as to suggest that this might be a way for the show to evolve. Moffat's story was a horror mystery that was genuinely baffling and scary--""The House That Jack Built"" for a new generation. To my mind, it not only bettered Moffat's previous work but was probably the best Doctor Who story ever. It was also the best Buffy story not to appear on Buffy (if Buffy had been what I'd wished it had); and the other story the best Quantum Leap (with the same condition). Series 3 was bidding fair to repeat the trajectory of series 1. Then, as in a game of chutes and ladders, it went down the chute, streaming an endless serial (by the producer, again) that revived the Master with a new and unbelievably irritating persona; and back we were where we'd started.The series 4 opener didn't bode well: it was the obligatory fat farting story for the year. However, the ""monsters"" in it were funny rather than icky, and the villainess responsible for unleashing them played her role with comic aplomb. Above all, the episode reintroduced Catherine Tate as the Doctor's new companion. She'd been paired with him once and then, apparently, cast off, very disappointingly to me--and I didn't even know who she was. Now here she was again; and I thought she was superb. Not only better than the two prior companions--both of whom were very good--but the best one ever. And the perfect match for her Doctor. Almost every actor who has played the role has found one perfect partner, and she was his. Their playing together was a joy to watch.Whether she inspired the writers, or whether Moffat--who it was announced would be taking over as producer for series 5--brought his influence to bear, or whether the show had more money to hire writers with, I don't know; but once the flatulent episode was out of the way, the season went on to the best set of stories, taken together, that the show has probably ever had. Every one took us somewhere, stimulated our brains, and had something to say. The show had retrieved its bearings and its moral voice. Once again Moffat contributed the season's crowning achievement, a story about a cosmic library, who ran it, and why; and this was even more awesome than his others. And he's the new producer! (I could almost wish he had a new Doctor, too, so we could see what he would devise starting from scratch.) From series 3 there would have been nowhere for him to go but up, I'd have said; now, after series 4, he well and truly has something to live up to.*** Postscript, Fall 2010: But alas, he didn't.",NEGATIVE,0.9350936412811279
8,"OK, so my first introduction to the revived series was right when it started. I was 11 or 12 when 'Rose' aired in 2005 and I was in awe/terrified when I saw the first episode. I would catch the odd episode here and there. Eccleston was very well cast and he did a great job, but David Tennant was the standout performance for me, and I began watching the show religiously.Russell T Davies did a great job in my opinion, although I do have to admit that the whole Doctor/companion romance wore a bit thin. (*cough cough* Rose) The Davies era was helpful in my general knowledge as well (i.e. throwaway lines about history/maths) So when Davies and Tennant stepped down to make way for Moffat and Smith, I was initially skeptical. Smith's Doctor in the first few episodes seemed to be doing his best Tennant impression, so it seemed a bit out of place. Smith grew on me as the series progressed but Moffat's writing pattern became repetitive and formulaic (i.e. massive buildup throughout the series resulting in a lackluster anticlimax) The sendoff for Matt Smith was done so poorly in my opinion, in that is was literally just a hurried attempt to tie up loose ends, which came across as a complete mess.When Capaldi hit the scene, I was excited. I'm a fan of his work on The Thick Of It so I was intrigued to see if any of those mannerisms would be carried over. And, in a sense, yes they were.Capaldi's Doctor started off fairly well (bit iffy about the sonic sunglasses and the general mid-life crisis vibe). However, there was waaaaay too much focus on Clara that it wasn't fair. The character of Clara was an uninteresting, bossy 'Mary Sue'-like character that slowed down every aspect of the plot. So when they were building up to her death, I was intrigued. But they just ruined it. Why devote so much time to saying goodbye to a character if ultimately, she's just gonna be resurrected and left to go off again? This was the point where I was fed up with the series.Davies, in a sense, was conscious of the reality and science behind the drama during his run, but to Moffat, it's just an absolute fantasy. You can't just use ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"" as a get-out-of-jail-free card every time the plot is getting too convoluted. It just got too repetitious and ridiculous.I have my fingers crossed for whatever Chris Chibnall does when he takes the reins, but as it stands now, the revived series has suffered a major fall from grace.",POSITIVE,0.999672532081604

There have been a few sporadic moments where the writers have taken advantage of this opportunity. But by and large the writers have made Jodie's tenure incredibly preachy. Nearly every episode's theme is basically human shaming. And it's getting really old. Rosa Parks, an obvious copy of Donald Trump, a pregnant man, a jab at Amazon, witches, leaving a couple people to die in favor of a rant about climate change... with the exceptions of the one about Tesla and Fugitive of the Jadoon, the only interesting episode was the one about the partition of India and Pakistan. i lose interest about 3/4 into every episode.

As I had nothing to do on that Saturday night I decided that it would not hurt to give the show a chance. After watching the debut episode of the relaunch, ""Rose"", I found it highly enjoyable. Two things I enjoyed the most about the show was the energy that the characters carried and the unique story line, it felt confident and was not afraid to be different. Of course after watching Episode 1 I decided to give the following few weeks a chance to see if the show continued to carry on dishing out creative and fun episodes.By the 4th episode of the new series 1 I realised to myself ""this is such a fantastic show"". I began to fall in love with the characters and the stories that were being executed were just brilliant. The show is simply based on ideas that the writers have which make it so unique and so creative. Eccleston was brilliant as The Doctor and brought so much energy to the show.Ecclestons departure was very sad indeed as he was my first Doctor and I felt that his chemistry towards Rose in series 1 was fantastic, however what I did not realise was the show was about to get even better. By the time Series 2 came along everything just got that whole lot better, the writers had become a lot more confident which meant all of those creative and unique story lines from series 1 suddenly got even more unique, out of this world and exciting. In my opinion the greatest part of series 2 was the episode 12 ending, it was simply just stunning! One year later series 3 was aired on our screens and this time the show no longer had Billie Piper. However this did not ruin the show what so ever. Yet again the stories got more unique and much more exciting and to me series 3 was the best New Who yet! Freema Agyeman took a while to get use to, however by episode 5 I had begun to find her character very enjoyable.Over the past 3 years I have felt that the show has continued to improve with each series.

Tennant does a reallt good job introducing the more chaotic nature of Dr. Who.Then starting at Season 5, when Matt Smith enters the stage, together with the best sidekick, Karen Gillan, the setup is complete. These seasons up to season 8 are the best. Not just the characters, but the storylines are just brilliant and definitely levels up from fun entertainment to also immersive storytelling.But ok, you know what's coming, a new doctor as usual. So, hopeful for a good continuation, but I just couldn't get into it any more. I've tried a few times with the first 2 or 3 episodes, but Capaldi is just not so convincing.

However, the anticipation and the pressure was great but I think the New series has passed the test it's good, it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws. Some of the stories ""Dalek"" were very poor. I assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the Dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series.""Aliens in London"" was by far probably the best episode so far, it started a new storyline about Aliens which has lasted across several episodes including ""Boomtown"".Now the other bad things, the companion, Rose, Billie Piper, isn't great. She's actually quite annoying but as is Dr. Who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part.Christopher Eccleston is pretty respectable, he's started to catch his niche. He tried to play the character, straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows.Continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well, Paul Mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back.Aside from that though the series overall is pretty good, I haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring, so I recommend any Doctor Who fan to check it out and see the new Doctor Who series.",NEGATIVE,0.9993003606796265
6,"A female doctor should have been great but instead its terrible. She really is the most uninteresting and dumb doctor of the lot. The writing is terrible and after all the preaching and shouting about race, sex and religion just made me switch off. I'll maybe come back too it when the Doctor and writing staff regenerate into something less preachy and dumb.",NEGATIVE,0.8975090980529785
10,"Doctor Who is the longest running British sci-fi series in history about a mysterious human-alien. Who travels in space and time in a spacecraft which looks like a police box on the outside. Every few years he experiences a ""regeneration"" whose looks and personality change in the series. He is also known to travel with a companion who is usually an attractive female, an alien, a robot or brave man.First season has Christoper Eccleston as the ninth doctor and pretty Billie Piper as his new companion Rose Tyler and brings back the Doctor's old enemy the Daleks. Christopher was good as the doctor, but sadly he left the series because of fear of being typecast. He was replaced by David Tennant (everybody remember him in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). Season two would have been three stars, but it was rather dull due to the showing of unnecessary romance. The romance between the lovesick Rose falling in love with the Doctor and completely abandon her boyfriend Mickey. It was starting to be a typical soap opera instead of a sci-fi show. Rose Tyler is a typical dumb blond, doing something instead of listening. She is an overrated character in my opinion. The season brought back the Cyberman too. I love the scene where the Cyberman vs. the Dalek in Rose's final appearance. Thank God Rose did not appear in the third season. She was one of those character you liked in previous seasons, but now turns into someone else a jealous/lovesick teenage girl (can you believe she got jealous of the Doctor's returning companion Sarah Jane Smith!) Recently on my 22nd birthday I got season three and four as a gift. The DVD are excellent they are full of action. The series introduced the Doctor's new companion; the beautiful Martha Jones and the funny Donna Noble. Season three is very good it has David Tennant and Freema Agyeman as the perfect couple with good chemistry. His relationship with Martha Jones is perfect it remind me of how a time travel movie would be today without the mushy stuff. Every man seem to be enchanted by Martha from Shakespeare to her Future fiancé. For her fearless resourceful skills. Sadly she left the series because of 2 reason. 1) to protect her family 2) she had to get over her unrequited love with the doctor. She thinking their love was never to happen. But secretly the Doctor does love her but he didn't want her to become Rose which he later regretted. She should have stayed in season four, she was an interesting character. I don't understand why people hated her and then there was Captain Jack Harkness who was also good. He was the perfect match for the Doctor. I wish he would have stayed in the series but he appears in the shows spin-off ""Torchwood"". With Martha, brilliant guest stars, the return of the dashing and charming Captain Jack and return of the Doctor's enemy the Master (played by Derek Jacobi/John Simm). Season three was excellent!! Season four was just as good with Donna Noble's return after she turned down the Doctor's offer as a companion. She became a good friend and was the only companion who didn't fall in love with him. Catherine Tate is very funny in her first appearance in show and all of season four. Her character also has perfect chemistry with David's Doctor.Martha Jones and Donna Noble were the tenth Doctor's best female companies. The Daleks and the Master are still the Doctor's greatest enemies in the series they make the series work. I current watch Doctor Who with the current Doctor and his new companion Amy Pond. You will love to see it. The show gets better and better!",NEGATIVE,0.9997833371162415
7,"From 2005 and the introduction with Eccleston I loved this show. Tennant and Smith were also brilliant in this series as well as the secondary characters and the writing. However, and unfortunetley, with the introduction of Capaldi and now as well with Witthaker, the series has gone down in enjoyment and is, like many others say, more about being political instead of making an entermainment show that people can watch to relax. Instead of being entertianed, the writiers shove down their political views on us, and even though it is real and important issues, it is not the reason why I, and many others, watch Doctor Who, I hate that they make the show this way and wmight be its downfall. I feel so sorry for Jodie Witthaker because I really like her and her take on being the first female Doctor. I really hope they go back to write a witty, hilarious series like they have in the past, and then, a lot of viwers will certainely come back and enjoy it once more, instead of just trying to endure it for the sake of it...",NEGATIVE,0.999474823474884

,"Doctor Who over the past few seasons has been going in the same direction as the Star Wars sequels. Diversity for diversity sake, making the main character more important and less mysterious than they once were. I can say with confidance that after Clara left the show it went down hill very fast.I've been a fan of the show since I first saw it when I was 9 (I'm 18 now) and I can't even watch the new seasons without something upsetting me. Nothing against the actors in the new seasons, they're actually the one part I can tolerate and it's not they're fault the show isn't good anymore. The effects have really gone down hill which is strange, because if the effects from the 2000's are better than the effects from 2020 then someone needs to be fired.The mystery of the Doctor and the Time Lords was what made the show so interesting but after the season 12 finale it just takes that all away. I liked the idea of the Doctor being a woman when I first heard it but then they added 3 side characters so it makes it crowded with to many side plots. The new Tardis and sonic are the worst they've ever looked (in my opinion).This show clearly hit its peak a long time ago and they should either do another full reboot or just end the show entirely.",NEGATIVE,0.9995834231376648
8,"Peter Capaldi wasn't the best Doctor, but he's tons better than Jodie. Same for her team, too many to follow, and doesn't compare to past companions. The actor who plays Ryan can't even act. Same blank emotion in every scene... how did he get the part?It's a bad sign when you wish your favourite Doctor Whos can come back. Think #11, Amy, and River. Think #10 and Donna Noble. #10 and Martha Jones. They sizzled. They commanded the action. Even Clara Oswald had a striking presence despite her cool demeanour.This team? Looks like characters I could meet in a shopping mall. Nothing standing out.I'm starting to hate the short pants on the new Doctor Who. The striped shirt and cloak are pretty cool but the shorts ruin everything. This is a serious mission not a walk on the beach. Now, when I see those pants, I cringe. All they need to do is lower the hems on the pants by about three inches. There! Problem fixed in that one tiny fashion sense.Some reviews have commented on the bad scripts featuring otherwise good actors. Nope. It's both. Bad scripts and bad actors. The guy who plays Graham is quite good, but he doesn't seem to belong there.I'm wondering if it's better to cut losses and start over?Other Doctor Whos had shaky starts but their worst episodes are so way better than this disastrous season.Seven stars for the entire season, notched down by two stars for this disastrous start of the new one.

8,"The thing about Dr. Who (and this stands for the new, as well as the old) is that about a third of the show is absolutely horrendous garbage, a third is mediocre, and a third is pure brilliance which makes you enthusiastic about watching the rest. At the point wherein you find yourself hooked on the show, getting absorbed into it and obsessed, your friends may come by. You'll urge them to watch. They will make comments about seeing it as a child, when the Doctor wore that long scarf, and will question whether you're serious about liking this show. You'll urge them to watch, to give it a chance. And if it's an episode that you haven't already seen, odds are it will be an embarrassingly wretched episode which will make you question your allegiance to Dr. Who.This keeps happening to me.The thing is, the new Dr. Who is, in a lot of ways, much better than some of the older Dr. Who --- a better effects budget, better acting, and in many cases better plots. Where the new show fails, it's generally in the episodes wherein it tries too hard to pay homage to old episodes, or where it tries to offer some alien-based explanation for a stupid one-off (werewolves? Ah, they're an alien race! Witches? An alien race! Vampires?...) New Who is more reliably good than Old Who, but it still has it's fair share of stinkers. The Season Specials are almost all horrifyingly awful. Any episode that relies on a particular historical figure (Shakespeare, for instance) is usually bad. But these are the same weaknesses that the show has always had.I've watched most of the Dr. Who from the 4th doctor (Tom Baker) to the present. I even watched the 8th doctor 'movie' (yaaaawwwwwnnnn). All in all, the show has gotten better. It helps to have a long mythology and an expansively defined Universe to work with.As endearing as the old Dr. Who was, it was often wretched. Many people who claim the show is no longer as good either reflect too fondly on memory or have only focused on the admittedly bad episodes which do crop up in the new series. When Tom Baker became the fourth doctor, and the writers wanted to make the show more science fiction than ... well, whatever silly nonsense it was before --- there was a huge outcry from the public that the show had changed for the worse. In an effort to appease those who want an 'old school' more 'magical' Dr. Who and a more sci-fi, somewhat darker Dr. Who, the show has straddled quite a gap. The result is that neither audience will be totally satisfied, but both will find enough to enjoy.Dr. Who is a fun show. It also can be thought-provoking at times. And it's absolutely addictive, like televised crack cocaine--- which I know nothing about, but feel comfortable referencing. The new Dr. Who does very well at creating grandiose story arcs, and while sometimes the resolution of these story arcs relies on some overly convenient plot twists, overall the result is some thoroughly enjoyable TV.I'd recommend it. Just be sure to watch several episodes before making a final decision, or else you may miss one of those brilliant episodes which makes it all worthwhile.",NEGATIVE,0.9953058362007141
10,"Doctor Who is so much more than a simple TV Drama. It is a Science-Fiction Drama with top- notch storytelling and acting. The show can choose whatever it wants to be whenever it wants: comedy, mystery, action, absurd, and so on. It never has a theme permanently used for the rest of the series. These themes can change from time to time, although it is mostly dramatic.The BBC wouldn't be what it is without the help of Doctor Who. Of course there's other classic BBC shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus, Fawlty Towers, Yes Minister, Black Adder, Red Dwarf and so on, but Doctor Who has the recognition of being the longest running Sci-Fi TV show in history.And to think 2013 will be a big year for Doctor Who fans celebrating the show's 50th Anniversary, it isn't the only big event next year. It will also be the 75th Anniversary of Superman. I know Superman has nothing to do with The Doctor in any way, but they are both technically superheroes from alien planets. One is a comic book hero and the other one is a telly hero. They are both dedicated to saving the universe and righting wrongs, and they both have deep histories of their own, leaving room for some potentially epic stories to be told.Doctor Who is the reason I love Science-Fiction. The possibilities are endless for the show, and they will probably never end as long as Doctor Who's around.

7,"Jodi Whitaker is an excellent incarnation of the Doctor. She's young, witty, intelligent and optimistic and a good transition from Peter Capaldi who started his reign as a dowdy, unsure and cynical Doctor. But the writers seem to be throwing a timetested formula (possibly due to pressure from BBC to reinvent) for something that could spell doom for the Franchise. Firstly, the first four episodes which should have been invested as usual in narrating the personal turmoil the Doctor faces after regeneration has been cast aside to develop the characters of the companions. Three is crowd when it comes to companions. The chemistry between Tenant and Billi Piper, Capaldi and Coleman and Matt Smith with Karen Gillan thrives with a smaller cast. It's easier to see how the Doctor becomes a better person by learning from the companions with fewer companions. I hope the cast gets trimmed in the future. Secondly, rumour has it that there will be no Daleks, cyber men or Angels in this season... REALLY? What makes this the longest running sci-fi franchise is that both the Doctor and his/her villains reinvent themselves just as often as the Doctor regenerates. This also brings into light the lack of continuity so far in the first four episodes. Each episode seems to be a stand alone. What happened to the ""Bad Wolf"", ""Silence will fall"" crack in the wall themes that added mystery to each episode and connected every episode leading to a season ending revelation? Yes it's awesome to finally have a lady play the Doctor especially after the Master became Missy (Which I might add would be cool if Jodi's doctor meets Missy) but we shouldn't have to rewrite the Franchise on that account. I may be wrong in the long run but let's see how the season unravels. The season is young. Stay tuned folks.",NEGATIVE,0.9990941286087036

I have tried so hard to get into Who, but after watching over 50 episodes (including classic Who) I am done. When watching over 50 episodes and you are hard pressed to think of a single one that is above average it's safe to say that you can be a quitter. I gave her the ol' college try for sure. Before I started this whole rating project I had completed series 1 of NuWho with the 9th doctor and eight episodes of series 2 with the 10th doctor before quitting for the first time. Having watched a few episodes of the 11th doctor and then moving on to the 12th, I watched the entirety of series 8 and seven episodes of series 9 before giving up the second time. Deciding to give it one more try I began with series 10, last series of the 12th doctor and at episode seven I finally decided to put myself out of my misery and abandoned the idea all together.  I want to like Doctor Who so much as it has many things that draw me in: time travel, morality tales, the time war, the daleks, the regeneration idea, but with poor storylines, terrible ploting, and a vast collection of big eyed monsters of the week I have determined that there's absolutely nothing to keep me here and continuing to punish myself.

I commend Russel T Davies for doing a fantastic job of propelling doctor who into the 21st century.I pity the old doctor who fans who say 'oh its just not the same'and Eccleston is 'too different to be the doctor'. They are right! its not the same! Neither are we! We are living in a different century to the old episodes and many things have changed. Set in modern day I think the episode was more realistic and 10 times more enjoyable.

The writers took away that feeling of an original sci-fi show and turned it into a cliche one. Do not waste your time after Capaldi, it is not worth it. I was very happy when they got a female doctor, but she has no personality and only people who just joined the Doctor Who fandom like her. She is not the Doctor at all.

By the other hand, the stories are simply good sometimes and excellent more frequently. You can enjoy the very different personalities of each Doctor.

9,"While this show is far from perfect, it certainly is one of the best ever made. The writing is incredible, the acting is so wonderful it can make you laugh or cry within seconds, and the special effects really pop out. The only downside is that, depending on the main characters, this show can be so good it's almost indescribable and so terrible, you wonder why you watch it in the first place (fortunately the latter is a rare occasion).The show starts out with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and Billie Piper as the shop girl/companion, Rose Tyler in one of the best seasons of the entire show's run. The chemistry is perfect, even the weaker stories have plenty of great moments, and the finale is epic and phenomenal. Eccleston delivers a wonderful performance and Piper follows his lead. The writing is nearly flawless (just ignore the Slitheen episodes, they're only good if you've seen the whole show and want to see some great character moments). So I was hooked and couldn't wait to see the new Doctor when Eccleston left the show.Unlike many, MANY people, I was actually disappointed in David Tennant's performance. He didn't have any of the previous incarnation's cleverness, though he certainly boasted about how clever he was through his entire 4 years in the role. He continually sank into depression about what happened to his planet (yeah, he killed everyone and the planet was destroyed; we see him heal a lot in the first season and then this Doctor came around to never let us forget how sad he is. It gets annoying FAST). The worst part of the second season is Rose. It's like a switch goes off in her brain and she becomes bratty and annoying, unlike her character in the first season. While the second season produces some really good episodes and has great moments, it is really bogged down by two weak main characters. This whole season made me knock off the tenth star and it is as bad as the show ever gets (which, admittedly, is still good and I still recommend it).Then season 3 introduces Martha Jones, played by Freema Agyeman, and we see a vast improvement. In fact, one episode in particular, the eleventh episode of season 3 called Blink, is so good, so clever, and so delightfully creepy that it is still one of my all time favorite episodes. I won't spoil it, you have to see it for yourself. The only drawback of season 3 is that the Doctor spends the entire time pining for Rose, which wastes the amazing Martha's potential.Then there's season 4. This one is one of the best since the first. The Doctor pairs with fiery temp, Donna Noble, played by British comedienne, Catherine Tate and it is absolutely incredible. No more moping Doctor because Donna simply won't let him. This leads to some of the best stories and the best moments of David Tennant's tenure. Unfortunately, the finale feels a little overdone, but it's worth it to see the antics of the Doctor and Donna.Then the show went off the air for specials, which, I have to say, were horrendous and another reason this show only gets 9 out of 10 stars. The Doctor travels alone and becomes more mopey and depressing than ever. There is not a single special worth watching, not one, in fact, the only salvageable part of the entire run was the regeneration scene in which Tennant's Doctor dies and regenerates into the 11th incarnation, played by Matt Smith.And THIS is where the show gets more incredible than ever. Season 5 does not have a single dud in the bunch, every episode is absolutely wonderful and entertaining. The Doctor joins Amy Pond, played by Karen Gillan, and her fiancé, Rory Williams, played by Arthur Darvill, and this season is one of the best sci fi seasons I've ever seen. The chemistry is perfect, the stories are nearly flawless, and the acting is perfect. Without a doubt, season 5 is the best one Doctor Who the 2005 series has ever done. I could go on forever as to how everything works so perfectly together but you have to watch it and see.The sixth season is currently running so I won't say anything about it but so far it hasn't been as good as the fifth while still being one of the best ever.So, bottom line, this show is AWESOME. I mean AWESOME. Yeah, it's got some moments which are terrible and David Tennant's Doctor really bogs the show down for a while, but Matt Smith's Doctor more than makes up for it when he takes over. I give this show a 9/10 stars, a star off for the bad stuff in the Tennant era. If you haven't seen it, grab it on Netflix, a video store (if they still exist), whatever, just don't miss this gem of a show!!",POSITIVE,0.9968120455741882
9,"NuWho is amazing and Dr Who is my favourite show ever lets break down each era.Christopher Eccleston era the era that started it all for me and were I started watching Dr who which makes this era so Nostalgic for me with great episodes like Dalek and Empty Child and Doctor Dances.
However this is my least favourite era overall in NuWho just simply because it hasn't aged that well and he only did one season so I find it hard to get attached to this Dr personally I do respect Eccleston alot for bringing back the show and without this season we wouldn't have it but I enjoy 10th 11th 12th era's overall just my opinion.
However there are some great moments in this season and the first time I ever saw a Dalek is a memory I will have forever and it scared me alot.
The first time I saw inside the TARDIS I've never been more thrilled and it still gets me every season.
I love the Badwolf story arc and it's definitely one of my favourites I also love the introduction to Captain Jack one of the coolest characters ever on Tv.
There are some underrated episodes in this season like Father's Day and I don't think Unquiet Death gets enough love.
However im not a big fan of the Slitheen two parter just abit to silly for me which didn't suit this era and I much prefer Boom Town.
My favourite episode is definitely Dalek some of the best acting in any of Dr who in my opinion and the first time we saw the Dr be scared and abit of his bad side which made me like this character more.
I was really disappointed that Eccleston left although the introduction for new fans to regeneration was very interesting and very shocking to see for the first time.The David Tennant era of Doctor Who I love this era Tennant still remains my favourite doctor of all time and will always be my Doctor even though I do prefer more stories in Matt's era.
However this does have some great stories and some excellent moments in Dr Who history I love Season 4 it's definitely my season of NuWho and there isnt a single bad episode in that season.
It also sees the return of some classic Dr Who characters Like the Sontarans and I love the new design It also brings back Davros who is a Dr who legend and his amazing in this season finale in Season 4.
This era brings back the Master for the first time played by John Simm who I think is brilliant in the role and plays a really sinister Master.
However this era does my least favourite companion in Martha wasn't really an interesting character in my opinion.
The era also has some really bad episodes like Love and Monsters and Fear her.
I love the way they bring back the Cybermen in this season really interesting origin story for them and a cool design.
Very upsetting saying goodbye to Rose at the end of season 2.
This season also has my favourite companion of NuWho which is Donna such a cool character and the companion that in my opinion has the best story arc in Doctor Who.
We also meet my favourite character for the first time River Song in a two part story which is amazing.
I also love specials from David and these are he's best episodes such a great way to end his era and the first time a TV show had me crying when he left David will always be my favourite Doctor and just a great era.
My moment in Tennants run his definitely the Timelord Victorious scene in Waters of Mars such well acted moment by him.My second favourite era in NuWho the Matt Smith era I love this era and this Doctor is my second favourite Doctor in all Dr Who after David Tennant.
The Stories in this era are just amazing and definitely think Matt has the best overall story arcs in the New series of Doctor Who I love the story of River Song and The Silence in Season 6 which is my second favourite season in NuWho.
Matt's era also has some of my favourite stuff in it I think he the best Sonic Screwdriver and his first TARDIS interior is my all time favourite I love it.
However I do think season 7 is definitely the weakest season in this era some episodes in that season I'm not a fan off like the Crimson Horror and Hide I've never really liked.
But I do think Asylum of the Daleks and Power of Three are very underrated.
My favourite episodes in this era is definitely Flesh and Stone and Time of Angels I love this episode and in my opinion it's better than Blink as it feels more like a Dr Who story.
There are so many great moments in this era my favourite being the Rings of Akkatan speech and the moment with Vincent Van Gogh in the meauseum is just perfect and really emotional.
The 50th anniversary episode is in this era and I think it's amazing I love everything about this episode love that we get to see stuff from the Time War and John Hurt as the war doctor is awesome and the Zygons came back and look incredible and the scene with Tom Baker is perfect for any Dr Who fan.
I also think Matt had the best acted regeneration scene his speech always gets me and it just make for a perfect end to a great era.
I also really like the twist that he is the last one in the first cycle really interesting twist and makes the overall story more complete for me.The Peter Capaldi era of Doctor Who i love this era and think it is slightly underrated now i will admit that Season 9 is definitely the weakest season in this era and in NuWho in general and the Hybrid Story wasn't really that interesting in my opinion. However there some really great stories i love the whole of season 10 definitely one of my favourite seasons and i love the introduction of Bill and the fact they brought back the Original Cybermen which made me go back and watch the Tenth Planet.
i also really enjoy season 8 and thought it was a great way to kick off the era with great stories like Into a Dalek which is very interesting i also really enjoy Dark Water and Death in Heaven really like the idea with the Cybermen in thar story.
i love the introduction of Missy such a great twist on the character of the Master and she gets better each season in my opinion.
Now there things in this era which do my head in i hate the Sonic Sunglasses such a stupid idea which didnt work in my opinion, However i do love his Sonice Screwdriver he gets after Hell Bent.
Hell Bent is my least favourite episode of Dr Who ever just huge disappointment and the Doctor is way out of character in that and undermines Heaven Sent which is the best episode in this era in my opinion.
i also really love the the dalek two parter in season 9 just because the scenes with Davros and The Doctor are always great to watch and i love them.
Capaldi in my opinion had the best Christmas Special in the Husbands of River Song which ties in with when we first met her in a 10th doctor story and we get to see there last days on Delirium which was a great way to end the River Song story.Verdict 9/10 great series and my all time favourite show a must watch for Sci-Fi fans",NEGATIVE,0.6965317726135254
7,"Very disappointed in the writers and producers of this show when they introduced gay companions, then a female doctor. This is supposed to be a family show, rated for children. Children don't need adults pushing the gay agenda on them. Then the female doctor after the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker) said yes it was possible to change sexes, but it's only done to procreate the species. In other words if there are two timelords left and they are the same sex one would regenerate to procreate. So this never should have happened. As for Jodie Whittaker, i'm not sure if it's the writers or her but her doctor SUCKs. In all the Doctor's regenerations he has kept his morals of life and death. This female doctor has fallen from that, letting alien beings suffer through their death rather than help. Maybe I'll return to watching when she is gone.",NEGATIVE,0.9973102807998657
10,"The show is nearly perfect, it's one of these shows that deserves to be so popular. While I always loved Doctor Who for its' great mix of classic scifi, emotional, romantic and great historical moments, the new season is really not like it's been before. 13th Doctor is not the problem. I also like Graham / Ryan and the plot of some episodes was good, but the rest is the problem. IMO it feels like Yasmin was just put in to have another woman in the cast, she seems kinda kindless and boring, still she is not the biggest problem. The plots were way better before and I think they made a HUGE mistake by making Chibnall in charge of the show, Moffat era was more my case and I even liked the episodes that were considered bad by most people.However, it has to be remembered that no other show managed to stay constantly good like this one and it was definitely the best Sci-Fi Series (not movie) for me to ever be made.The show could be as great again, just fire Chibnall, the 13th Doctor is great she is not the problem, just make better plots again.",POSITIVE,0.999466598033905
6,"Before ""Doctor Who"" was one of my favorite seriels (I started to watch this series more than 7-8 years ago), however from season 10 it started to get worse and worse. His new assistant, she was so boring and so stupid (and I dont care if she was a gay).
But from season 11 serial get even worse...
I'm not racist, but serial became too politically correct.
We have a lady ""Doctor Who"" (Ok); +
Family with black lady and white man; +
Police lady, who have problems with her job because she is woman (also she is an Indian of course) ; + + +And all of this in one season.

Halving the viewing base in less than a season is a truly astonishing achievement.Jodie Whittaker has been seriously miscast. Doesn't suit the character at all. The ""fam"" companions are also miscast. Just awful acting all around. They are let down by the writers but the show is just a mess.I've watched doctor who for decades.

,"Outstanding! I've just watched the episode where Pertwee's and Baker's Dr. Who companion, Sarah Jane Smith (played by the lovely Elizabeth Sladen) makes a guest cameo appearance. And... and.. And... AND, K-9! Replete with John Lesson's voice to reprise the role.I mean.. WOW! This is terrific! I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I applauded! :-) When things looked rough for the Doctor, I shouted at my TV, ""Bring in K-9!"", and sure enough my favorite mechanical pooch was there serving as the Doctor's best friend, and many a best friend of many a child on after school television. What could be better? :-) I saw a couple episodes previous to this, and was impressed with the production values, and liked what I saw. But, it wasn't until this bit of nostalgia blast that this show, after laying siege to my heart with its upgraded and upbeat revamping of the classic series, captured my heart.I willingly surrendered to not only the high gloss, but the core character of the entire series, the adventurous, ever moral, ever smart, ever upstanding, ever caring, ever clever, never dying, always regenerating, and rather eccentric genius and all around good guy, The Doctor (a.k.a. Drax back on Gallifrae (spelling?)).The Doctor I grew up with was not the dashing leading man of swash-buckle fair. No, he was your best friend in chemistry class. The cool instructor who was cool because he was so damn smart and wanting you to learn what he knew because he cared for you, and valued all living things. :-) These are what make the Doctor such a magnificent character, and such an alluring figure for children and adults alike. He is the everyday hero whose smarts out-weigh his good-looks of which he has very little. Why? Because he doesn't need them.The series has been reborn with great aplomb! The pacing was much faster and much more upbeat, and the production values are far improved from the video tape episodes of yesteryear that relied on video graphics and primitive video blue screen SFX. But, then again, that was part of the charm of the old episodes. The story and the characters.The BBC has ratcheted up Doc Who for a new generation, and I am very pleased to have seen it reborn.You must see this! Now! Enjoy! :-)",POSITIVE,0.9998192191123962
10,"Since the revival series started back in 2005 I have been hooked. I think that everything fits in perfectly.The two actors that have played the Doctor have been brilliant, although I sometimes got the impression that Christopher Eccleston did not want to be there. And before you say anything I know he asked to play the role. I do think he has given a good performance throughout his single season. The thing that I cannot understand about his decision to leave is that if you act in something as iconic as Doctor Who there will always be those that see you as that character.David Tennant has shown that is a brilliant actor and also that he is enthusiastic. When I heard he was leaving I felt a bit disappointed but it needed to happen eventually. For me he has been the better of the two and should be praised for the way has taken to the role.As for the companions I do not feel disappointed. I think that all of them have been great. My favourite companion has to be Martha Jones, played by Freema Agyman, her development was probably the best of them all. I thought that Donna Noble, played by Cathrine Tate, was great but a bit to in your face. Rose Tyle, played by Billie Piper, was good but a seemed to play a little bit of a tart. Captain Jack I think is a good equal to the Doctor and is portrayed brilliantly by John Barrowman.The writing is for the most part 'fantastic'. There have been a few episodes/stories that have not been quiet so good such as Love and Monsters, Fear Her and The Unicorn and the Wasp. On the other hand there have been episodes that are just hands down brilliant, examples include, Blink, Dalek and The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit.The music is great. They definitely went down a different route from the old series that was famous for its mostly electronic music. This series uses an orchestra instead.Overall a great series with only a few tiny flaws.Oh and good luck Matt Smith.",POSITIVE,0.9990695118904114
10,"This show is my favorite TV show in general, I've always heard of Doctor Who but I never fully got into it at least until somewhere in my twenties and once I got into it, you can say it was like going into the Tardis for the first time. Once I came in, I never came back out and I just kept going. Doctor Who is just fantastic in not just the Pulp Hero category but also in both the Time Travel/Space Opera subgeneres. There is just so much to this show, and literally there is as it has gone on for years, it would probably take years just to cover and explore all of the ground, which makes it all the more better because just like the show getting into the franchise can be an adventure in itself.1. The character Doctor Who is my favorite fictional protagonist of all time. The guy to me is sort of like MacGyver but in space, just like MacGyver he doesn't use guns but his intelligence and wits to win which I personally think is great and a good message showing you don't have to have muscle or even resort to lethal force to win, if you have a good heart and head you can triumph. The guy has a great three dimensional personality, he's like a guy I could easily be friends with as he's sort of childlike with most things which makes sense since he's an alien. He's energetic, spontaneous, determined, selfless, etc. He has the mind of a master chess player as he's always moves ahead and can plan quickly when things get really hot. But what really makes him great for me is the fact that he's a walking enigma, he wasn't called Doctor Who for nothing as we sometimes decover different things about him and his past.There is even the fact that he's a dopleganger with his regenerative ability which of course reflects this. It was a daring move but surprisingly it works as each of the different versions of the Doctor are played by different actors. Each of the versions are different and yet the same character. Four of my favorites are Peter Capaldi, Tom Baker, Matt Smith and no.1 for me is David Tennant all of them are just awesome in their own way.2. The Companions are also great for the Doctor both professionally and as a friend. His relationships with each of them are always different which makes the dynamic always fresh and new with each one. Two of my favorites are Rory Williams and Amy Pond (count them as one since both are together) and my number one fav is Sarah Jane Smith whom is just awesome as she's an investigative journalist got a lot of spunk, charisma, but can really hold her own against danger.3. The stories are fantastic as each of them are always different. The show runs on both a developing plot line (or at least hint at one) and sometimes random which is great that they utilize both, each of the episodes are always a different adventure which makes it sort of unpredictable and enhances it's elements of both fascination and danger. There are a lot of writers I like that have contributed well, my favorite one is Steven Mofit whom I think is just fantastic most of his work is always a clever mystery, which can be real brain twisters.4. The mythology: This show is just rich in the depth of it's universe and the creatures that reside. Of course the ones that have always terrified me are the Dalieks whom are basically rolling tanks. They might be a little easy to get away from due to the speed they run but the problem is their is a lot of them, and if they corner you or even one of them does then your fraked. Plus, their not the easiest to kill, let alone armed with lasers which really gives them an edge. 5. The Rogues: Where there are heroes there are also villains and they villains in most episodes don't disappoint. My favorite one and my favorite fictional villain of all time is ""The Master"". This villain is both fun and menacing at the same time. He is the perfect antisis for the Doctor as just like the Doctor, he is unpredictable. The conflicts between both the Doctor and the Master play out like a chess match as it always fifty fifty anyones game, the Master is just moves ahead of the Doctor and were always wondering if the Doctor can catch up and get steps ahead of him. However what makes this villain truly unique for me is that he's loves playing games and he doesn't really hate the Doctor. Despite the fact that he loses to him, he's not entirely sore about it, it just means the game can continue. And despite with each plan he could easily conquer or destroy the world he always wants the Doctor to try and stop him because he enjoys the challenge. And of course there is the fact both use to be best friends which goes with the old motif of friends becoming enemies.6. The music, the theme song is my favorite theme song of all time. It fits the nature of the show perfectly as it has this eerie, mysterious but also sci-fi like tone to it. But also I like some of the music in most of the episodes, which is most of the time an orchastratic score which is perfect as there are some adventurous and suspenseful themes but also some with lots of emotion which are my favorites.Doctor Who isn't just a show, it's an adventure though space and time.Rating: 4 stars",NEGATIVE,0.991434633731842
10,"I reviewed this show after only one episode, and I was amazed at how good it was. Now, 13 episodes later, I've decided to update my review. Thank you Russel T Davis, you have brought back Doctor Who, and he's even better than ever. I thought all hope was lost when the name was handed over to the Americans, and we were left with a God-awful movie that nearly killed the franchise. But now he's back, and in my opinion, the new show is putting the old to shame. The characters are so well developed, you actually learn that there are consequences to the Doctor's actions and for the first time ever, tears are brought to people's eyes, especically in the later episodes. Now we have to wait until Christmas to see any more new episodes, and I can't wait.1. Rose: A great way to begin the show. The episode focuses mainly on the companion Rose and is hilarious to watch.2. The End of the World: A fun second episode. We learn a little more about the Doctor in this one, the only problem being the Scooby-Doo style ending.3. The Unquiet Dead: One of my favourites, I hope in series 2 there are many episodes set in the past rather than the future.4. Aliens of London: Quite good, but the aliens suffering from flatulence began to annoy me. I loved the scenes with Rose and her mum though.5. World War Three: The weakest episode of the new series, I just didn't like the Slitheen.6. Dalek: Wow what an episode, I just loved it. The character of the Doctor really developed in this one.7. The Long Game: Simon Pegg is great in this episode, but you can't help but hate Adam.8. Father's Day: Brought several tears to my eyes, very emotional episode, Billie Piper is awesome.9. The Empty Child: Great stuff, I love the special effects, war time London is great.10. The Doctor Dances: I really enjoyed this one, fun action and you've got to love the character Captain Jack.11. Boom Town: Hmm, good stuff, I loved the way you were left questioning the Doctors morals all the way through, but this also felt like a filler episode to me.12. Bad Wolf: A really great cliffhanger, but I think there was too much of the Weakest Link and Big Brother.13. The Parting of the Ways: Wow! My favourite Doctor Who episode ever, and that includes the original series. I was left in tears when the Doctor played a goodbye message to Rose.It's been a long 16 years since Doctor Who was first cancelled, we almost lost it due to a very bad film, but now it's back. Roll on 2006!",POSITIVE,0.9926313161849976
9,"After crying during Doomsday, I awaited the Doctor's return after Runaway Bride (which was, by the way, brilliant). When I heard that Freema Agyeman was to play the next companion, I wondered if she was a good choice. I was and am a Rose Tyler fan and I was not willing to let my loyalties die just yet.I suppose Martha (Freema's character) is good in her own way. However one thing that annoyed me was her breathy ""Doctor!"" which sounds like a hysterical teenage fangirl. Her character seems a little one dimensional, and the chemistry between the Doctor and Rose was not there with him and Martha.The episodes in Season 1 and Season 2 were perfect: emotional, humorous and smart. The new season, however, has been disappointing. The episodes have been cheesy and feel recycled. What Russell T. Davies seems to be delivering is that all female companions (at least in the new seasons) fall for the Doctor after seeing ""what an amazing man he is."" I hope that there will be some improvements in the seasons ahead. But, for the moment, I can only give the third season a 4 out of 10 stars.",POSITIVE,0.9970541000366211
10,"I've met people who are quick to dismiss this show because of its silly aliens, or perhaps its trademark awful special effects, or even its relentlessly passionate fan base whose conventions, costumes and sheer devotion to the show rival Star Trek fans. These are all apt observations, but in my opinion, Doctor Who is about much more than the average Monster of the Week.The show, with its constantly switching cast, manages to stay anchored emotionally despite its ever-changing face. With respect to the older series, the revamped version has seen characters such as the grief-stricken Ninth Doctor, the resourceful and exuberant Tenth, the wise yet whimsical Eleventh, smart-mouthed Donna Noble, whip-smart Martha Jones, brave Rose Tyler and no-nonsense Amy Pond. This is a show that is, above all else, about its characters, and the relation between these characters. Although it is often full of action, clever writing and the occasional temporal paradox, without its emotional core the show would not have such a devoted fan base, and would not be half as good.",NEGATIVE,0.6917218565940857
10,"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of what we wanted. In 1999, the ""man"" was gone and the newbies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the Doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi Channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the Dr. Who mythology for new viewers. It is incredible to me that they have done it. In Season 1, staring Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead writer, and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always been about ""Choice"", ""Love"" and ""Sacrifice"". This is what they provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston has chosen to leave the show. My first Doctor was Doctor no. 3, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston needn't worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe. It is as solid as the rest. He is the 9th Doctor. I didn't know of Mr. Eccleston prior to his performance in Dr. Who, but I do now. I wish there was some way, he could know, there is push out in the Dr. Who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it.

3,"I have watched the first three episodes of the new season and I'm sorry to say that Chris Chibnall's writing has let down both Doctor Who and Jodie Whittaker.I thought the show was meant to be 'family entertainment', but the infantile writing has aimed it at just the children. Chris Chibnall has a fantastic budget to write with, but so far has failed (imo) to come up with anything with dramatic tension. And Jodie Whittaker has had some god-awful lines that will make it difficult for anyone to endear to her.Episode 3 'Spiders in the UK' left me aghast at how bad the ending was. The build up was OK and the SFX with the spiders was very good, but to end with 'Oh, well, they'll die. Let's go home' was the writing of a teenager who just wanted to finish his homework.The episode also contained an attempt at a Donald Trump joke - a contemporary reference in a sci-fi show is not a good idea. It just helped to show the amateurish nature of the writing.This might be a little unfair on poor Jodie - David Tennant could run and it was used to generate tension in many episodes. Jodie can't run! She looks like your mum in an egg-and-spoon race at a primary school sports day - not good for dramatic tension.Having three 'companions' is the dumbest idea I have ever seen in Doctor Who. The point of the companion was they either got into trouble or they helped the Doctor out of trouble. Is that possible with three companions? So far they have just been an advert for inclusivity (BBC at it again!).I loved the reboot by Russell T. Davies, but this show no longer tries to equal the standards set by the man. Disappointed.",NEGATIVE,0.995486319065094
,"I'm writing this after watching The Caretaker, episode six in the twelve-part series eight. And what an atrocious series it's been so far.I speak as a (40-something) lifelong Doctor Who fan. So why the ire? Many reasons. It's not necessarily because of Peter Capaldi, who may be a decent actor. But one problem IS the character of the Doctor, which is all over the place. One example: in Into The Dalek he takes coldly logical decisions, including ensuring a colleague dies; the actions of a level-headed military commander. And yet he now appears to hate soldiers. Huh? How do they square that one? (I'll reveal how they do later.)Worst of all, character-wise, he's now an idiot, a fool, someone who gets it wrong, as in Robot Of Sherwood. A darker side was hinted early on but more often they just make him look silly and out of step. His companion, or whatever the PC term now is, Clara, is now the wise one, the dynamic one, the one who does brave stuff. Clara was actually quite likable in the last series but is now deeply irritating: Jenna Coleman's mannered, twitchy, doe-eyed performance is enough to make you wish your toenails were being pulled out. Acting-wise, though, she's nowhere near as bad as Samuel Anderson as Danny Pink, an actor with roughly the same versatility and range as a park bench, unable to show more than one emotion, no matter what he is faced with.And the two together: forgive me for yawning when I'm not vomiting. Their sub-Coupling romance is not only totally unconvincing but utterly boring. Yes Mr Moffat, you're oh so clever with your snarky dialogue ticks and the use of the word 'stuff', but do you really think the kids are into all this talky, tedious stuff that belongs 1,000 miles away from Doctor Who? And having characters continually tell one another to 'shut up' is not only lazy writing but grating and unpleasant to hear.I also hate the way the Doctor and Clara aren't properly travelling together, and the way he comes to the school or her flat and picks her up occasionally - if there's anything that'll remove any sense of wonder from the show this is it. Other problems? Well how about the basic stories? Deep Breath was indigestible stodge; Into The Dalek feeble fan fiction; Robot Of Sherwood had people getting locked up, shouting at each other and then saving the day in an absurd way; Listen was portentous and made no sense; Time Heist was a joyless heist caper; The Caretaker was like a cross between The Sarah Jane Adventures and a bad episode of Coupling, a boring, verbose, parochial smudge of an episode.A major issue is that the show is so full of itself. Bolstered by a wildly successful 50th anniversary episode, it now believes its own publicity. It sniggers to itself, it binge-eats its own mythology, it believes it's so much more than a kids' show, it thinks it has to convey 'socially important' messages. It's forgotten its primary objective, which is to be an entertaining adventure programme with characters we can take to our hearts.And finally, just to fully ensure that I get plenty of NOs on the 'was this helpful to you' bit, a comment on how left-wing the show now is. It's pro-gay, pro-multicultural, pro-feminist, anti-military (which explains the absurd contradiction in the Doctor's character). Stridently so in fact, so it interferes with, and warps, the storytelling. In short, it's everything the left-wing socialist Steven Moffat believes in. That's why you don't get, for example, messages about standing up for cherished institutions, fighting for what is right as dictated by common sense and human nature, or getting from life what you put in to it. These sorts of messages are alien to the left. (How appropriate that Clara was clutching a copy of cherished left-wing bible The Guardian in one episode.)But to end on a non-political note: Doctor Who simply isn't as much fun as it used to be, it's not exciting or suspenseful or thrilling. Declining viewing figures may confirm that am I not alone in this opinion.",NEGATIVE,0.9996987581253052
8,"I really hope the writers have worked the 'awkwardly goofy but enduring hip pretty boy pining away for his attractive but already attached companion' thing out of their system because I'm finally watching the show again.Look, I understand that they wanted to try something new, and they clearly wanted to appeal to a younger female audience, and it spawned a whole horde of heart-filled fan art of the would-be couples in 'maybe' love, but it really got to the point where I felt they lost what Doctor Who was all about.The Doctor isn't standing in the rain pulling a sad-face because he thinks his companion might be in love with another person. The Doctor isn't some flirty young hipster in an ENDLESS quasi-romance with his quirky travel companion that really distracts from everything else and makes the show feel like a cheesy romantic comedy with time travel.Why was he pining away for Amy for so damn long? Isn't he married? Who wants to even see Doctor Who become a paperback romance novel and not the kick-ass sci-fi fun it used to be? Who asked for this? Yes, the female fan base may have loved it, and yes they deserve to, but at what point does the Doctor cease being the Doctor? When does Doctor Who start to turn into 'Twilight'? All hope really seemed completely lost and I was about done with the show entirely.THEN PETER CAPALDI TO THE RESCUE! Wait, we have a Doctor that actually doesn't see his companion as an attractive young female he'd like to awkwardly court for a year like most of the more recent Doctors have?Wait, he looks at her almost objectively and as more than a giggling cute chick hitching a ride? Wait, he sees her as an abstract individual, and a partner? Wait, he's more pensive, a bit distant, mysterious and even aloof? He feels like an actual alien being and a learned master of time and space? Oh yes, Capaldi is the quintessential Doctor. He's an alien not desperately trying to find love or be more human, he's a mature time-lord that doesn't behave like some schmaltzy guy on a blind date trying to awkwardly impress his fidgeting A.D.D. would-be love interest. He's perfect and they've written him like the Doctor needed to be written. I actually like the show again, and I praise them for not pursuing the already worn out quasi-companion-romance angle.I'm really glad he's not some goofy hipster-like pretty-boy or some other obvious fan-girl bait. I'm ecstatic, actually.The last couple of seasons felt like one long schmaltzy awkward 'first date' that may or may not end in a kiss and it was torturous.I don't need to see the Doctor Rom-Com for a while.I can only hope the boastful ""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Doctor, now tremble and fear me!!!!"" monologues will also NEVER return.I cringed every time Matt delivered those, and he did quite often.",NEGATIVE,0.9989587068557739
8,"I'd alwasy loved Doctor who. It was one of the finest sci-fi shows. It contained mysteries, action, fantasy and deep things too that make you think about the existense and life itself.When i heard that the new dcotor will be a woman, I dind't knew what to think, but I accepted it very quickly. All that matter is the actor, not his gender.Jodie could gave been one of the best doctors. One that we would always have remembered as the first female doctor, who was wonderful. Now we will remember her as the doctor who could be so much more than what she were.Chibnall practically murdered the series very cruelly. He shattered the show before our eyes. From the first Chibnall season i hoped that he just quit, but unfortunately he didn't. He didn't just ruined the show, he stole the possibility of greatness from Jodie. The writing was garbage. The characters were not well structured. This last 3 season didn't make any sense at all.Chibnall soon will be gone, but i'm uncertain that this show can be saved or can be redeemed. I would be happy, if the new showrunner just wipe this out from existence, for instance like the doctor just dreamed this or something like that.The things i'm sorry the most is the fandom and Jodie. The fans the we had to seen this mess, and Jodie because she could have been an amazing doctor with a competent showrunner.I won't write spoilers from this 3 season, because almost all the episodes were bad, i can't write too many good things, and so many bad thigs had in these 3 season the would be an eternity to write them all. It destroyed and defiled all the foundation of Doctor who. I think this one sentence is the best what we can use to describe the Chibnall era. He wanted to do great things, surpass his predecessors, but we couldn't have imagined a bigger downfall.I can only hope that there is still salvation for the series with the next showrunner. I would even be happy if this 3 seasons were re-filmed with Jodie, with another showrunner so Jodie could get what she really deserves.",NEGATIVE,0.9998118281364441

8,"Doctor Who encourages your imagination with superb stories & great acting. It got a reputation as having bad special effects but we ignored that because the scripts were so good. After the hiatus, Russell T.Davies (RTD) was great as Exec Producer bringing it into the C21st with better production & great scripts. Steven Moffat's one-off episodes during this time were excellent, so much so no-one complained when he took over from RTD as Exec Producer with a new Doctor. This is when the show declined. Moffat created nonsensical storylines & muddled scripts explained away by rebooting Time or just ignoring the flaws. But the main foul-up caused by Moffat and the BBC's PC insistence, was reducing the great Doctor to a sideshow to his companions who treated him as an annoying parent, the stories turning into preachy lessons & riding roughshod over established history. Moffat's latter writing of Capaldi's Doctor made him a parody of himself, much the same way John Nathan Turner ended up doing to McCoy in his last series as Exec Producer. With a new look show starting in 2018, will the Rot continue or will it regenerate back to greatness?..",NEGATIVE,0.9994152784347534
10,"When the first episode of the new Doctor Who was due to air I sat on the living room chair all day in front of the TV Pinned to the TV screen watching documentaries and re-runs of the old Doctor Who. I didn't even change out of my P.J's. I was not to be disappointed. I had chills of excitement after watching the first episode and out of all those that have been aired so far, I have only missed one. I am now a full fledged Doctor Who fan and was one for a very short time before the new series aired. I saw a clip of the Tom Baker Doctor falling from the satellite cables and became fascinated almost immediately. But you don't need to be a sci-fi fan or familiar with the series to enjoy it. Gorgeous men like David Tennant and John Barrowman are worth 45 minutes of my time any day. The other stars of the show, Christopher Eccelston and Billie Piper (I would say the most recent companion's name as well but I can't remember how to spell it and I'm too lazy to look it up) were fantastic! Their acting was incredible and I was so sad to see them leave.As a message to those people who hate this show for various reasons, you are strange. If you think the acting is bad, then you are the kind of person who would go to Jurassic Park and only be impressed if you saw a Brachiosaurus balancing china plates on its head and tail while riding a unicycle. Sorry, but some things just can't match your level of expectations.",POSITIVE,0.9305954575538635
9,"1) It has a Star Trek-esque ""optimistic"" tone to it. Rather than villains suffering a violent defeat at the hands of the protagonist, villains are often forgiven, healed, given a new perspective, or revealed to be ""misunderstood monsters"". (Exemplary line: ""Because I'm The Doctor and I cure people!"")2) It's a show with ""boundless horizons"". There aren't a lot of settings that can potentially be a mash-up of any / all other genres. Superhero & Anime milieus are about the only ones I know of. Dr. Who is another one. On any given day, you could go from the stone age, through the Renaissance, up to modern times, and on into the far-flung future. Along the way, you could find magic, science, superstition, the mundane, and the supernatural all colliding together. Infinite possibilities.3) It has the charm of a British hero. There's something quaint about a protagonist who saves the day at the same time that he's checking his pocket watch, or pining for a cup of tea. This is a quality we love about Bilbo Baggins, Arthur Dent, and Sherlock Holmes. Turns out we love The Doctor for the same reason.4) It's a show that mixes mystery, terror, humor, and romance all very well. Not a lot of shows can do this. Buffy pulled it off week-to-week. Supernatural has done a reasonably good job. Dr. Who mixes them all expertly, sometimes blending them all together in the same scene. (The episode ""Doomsday"" is perhaps the best example.)5) It has cute trappings / furnishings: A time machine shaped like an old 60s police box, it's bigger on the inside, the sonic screwdriver is the universal do-it-all tool, psychic paper is the license to go anywhere. Not only are these intriguing in their own right, they're also useful plot devices.6) It evolves over time. The ability to have The Doctor regenerate and pick up new companions keeps things from getting stale. There aren't a lot of shows that have run since the early 60's (with one large break in the middle). If you don't like the set of characters they've got now, wait a bit and they'll deal out a new hand that they might like better.7) It's welcoming to newcomers. You don't need to start at the very beginning and ingest hundreds of episodes to get up to speed. Just jump in anywhere you like 'cuz they'll re-explain things like the TARDIS and Time Lords and whatnot to the viewers at regular intervals.8) It's a show that can be watched with the whole family. There are some scenes that are a little scary / frightening, but not gory or disgusting. There is occasional romance, but it's pretty innocent stuff. It means something to me to have a show I can watch with the wife & kids that we can all enjoy and talk about later.9) Many of the scripts feel like they're written by a 6-yr old (kind of like ""Axe Cop""), to wit: ""The Doctor falls out of the sky! Then some green, spiky-headed, aliens show up! Then a bunch of planets appear in the sky!"" Instead of rolling my eyes though, I'm delighted with this. I think it helps me to tap into my own ""childlike sense of wonder"" from days of yore.",POSITIVE,0.7193708419799805

Women are limited due to their lack of strength, yet we know CGI can give Whitaker all the strength she needs to complete a scene but it's unrealistic.I haven't watched the show since the first three episodes with Whitaker. She just doesn't have the personality of ""the"" Doctor, like Tennant, Smith and Capaldi. Good god bring one of these guys back. They were the best three doctors the show ever had.And I also agree with Little_C in bringing back Moffat and Davies to get the show back on track, otherwise, after nearly 70 years it will be gone with the wind.I hope the BBC will make some changes and help this superb longest running sci-fi program survive.

It took about 5 episodes before I just wrote the program off. I did come back a couple of times but saw no improvement. When Whittaker took over I stayed away. Recently I did check out three of her episodes. She might have been all right, had Tennant not been a previous Doctor. The two main points I disliked were that her acting just seems like a poor man's rip off of Tennant's, and I just couldn't wrap my head around the whole entourage of disinteresting character thing.",POSITIVE,0.9998124241828918

,"It seems that there is a huge diversity in the reaction to this show. Fortunately for the IL' Doc, I think this means he will be around for awhile again. I have seen ""Rose,"" The first episode in the revamped BBC series, and I have to say I am thrilled. The majority of the negative reviews seem to be coming from ultra-die hard Whovians. I myself was a giant DR.Who nerd in my younger years. I had a subscription to Dr.Who magazine, I sent Tom Baker a letter when I was 10 years old, (I still have the autograph he sent me back, thank you Tom!)My grandmother knitted me an eight foot long scarf etc..etc..I could tell you who Roger Delgado is and why when he looked like Geoffery Beevers he really wanted to go on Holiday to Traken.In early 1984 when I was 8 years old, I met the Doctor and his friends Sarah and Harry. It was at midnight in Arizona on a black in white television that was barely 10 inches wide. I was transported to somewhere I had never been and have never been since. It was like Peter Pan taking you to Neverland. Anyone who met Doctor Who at such an early age will agree with me that the magic was that vivid and so real that you felt you were right there side by side with those characters.As I grew up, I grew out of it. Real life takes a hold, and while Perpugilliam Brown was amazing to stare at, it became a lot more important to go talk to a girl in person on a Saturday night than stay home by the time 16 years old came around. A passing interest in Sylv and Sophie was there, but ultimately, Puff the magic dragon let out a mighty roar because this Jackie Paper had grown up.Having said that, I watched ""Rose"" with two hats. The former obsessive fan with the critical eye, and the adult who wanted to be whisked away by Pan again.I feel the show succeeds in the latter department. I had a huge smile on my face the entire 45 minutes, and if I had to guess, this show is going to capture the fancy of a lot of young ones, and even though Doctor Who was always my best friend, I'm ready to share him with the people who he was made for in the first place. Thank you Russell and welcome back Doc!",NEGATIVE,0.995110809803009
10,"Before I start this review, I just want to ask why IMDb considers the show when it ran from 1963-1989 and the show when it made a return in 2005 two different series? Anyway, I guess I have to review the 2005 continuation then.'Doctor Who' follows the adventures of a time/space travelling alien only known as the Doctor and his various companions as they meet and go to many bizarre, wonderful or terrifying people and places. The episodes can vary from being funny, action packed, thrilling, mysterious or scary, usually a combination of any of them.And that is what is so great about this show. It's the kind of show where anything can happen and you can accept it. Our heroes can go from fighting an alien werewolf in Victorian Scotland alongside Queen Victoria herself to stopping clockwork robots from taking Madame de Pompadour's brain to power their space ship a couple of episodes later (No really, that does happen in the second series.) The sheer imagination that goes into each and every episode is just astounding.Another great thing is that the characters never get overshadowed by the monsters and locations. They're great characters played by great actors. If I went into every one of them, this review would go on forever but trust me when I say they are incredibly well-written and well-acted.With that said, I guess I could go over the Doctors. It should come as no surprise to even people who do not watch the show that the actor playing the Doctor changes every few years because of the character having to go through a face and personality change whenever they receive a fatal injury. At the time I am writing this review, there has only been three different Doctors since the 2005 revival. Christopher Eccelston, David Tennant and Matt Smith play the 9th, 10th and 11th Doctors respectively and if I had to say who was my favourite is difficult as it really is like comparing apple and oranges since each new Doctor is like a completely new character. In terms of who's the most entertaining has to be the 11th though. Matt Smith can act both dramatically and goofy whenever he needs to be but I really like his more goofy moments as it really plays up the mad scientist aspect of the Doctor and he's just so into the role that I'm convinced he really is the Doctor.I also got to give kudos to Murray Gold's fantastic musical score, perfectly complimenting each scene, ranging from big and epic to subtle and atmospheric.Is there anything bad with the show? Of course there is. The show uses a mixture of practical and CGI effects and while the practical effects are excellent (Seriously, they're movie quality.) the CGI is pretty bad. I know it's only a TV show, but still, they could have done a much better job. Thankfully the CGI has gotten much better during the last few years and hopefully will continue to improve.Another thing is that each series has a loose arc with a running theme that is not really explained until the end. The last few series (At the time I am writing this review.) have very complicated explanations that don't really make much sense the first time you watch them but with repeated viewings it becomes much clearer and you can appreciate the writing even more.To sum things up, Doctor Who is a must see for anyone who claims to be a fan of Sci-Fi, with great characters, writing and mythos behind it and I can't wait for the second half of series 7 to begin.",POSITIVE,0.9997742772102356

Things you normally wouldn't end up thinking about it.It's getting better and better in the first 2 seasons i would have rated it 7-8/10 but the dept of the series has made me a true follower of the dead Doctor. We had season 5 and 6 that were converging to a climax halfway in season 7 (imagina that ...) that brought tears to my eyes.Even now when i hear the Amy Pond Theme song i get tears into my eyes and I was absolutely sure that they couldn't do this amazing achievement again... But a few episodes later i found out they are doing it once more...The casting is as always PERFECT. The special effects are perhaps a bit old fashioned but that's what makes the Doctor, Who he is. Bowties are cool!Giving and example, after Tennant i didn't think that the next doctor could fill his shoes and the series would die silently.

Finally after a million years, we were given Christopher Eccleston as the 9th doctor, and he was great. A modern, not so eccentric doctor, he brought realism to a role that was once populated by long scarfs and stalks of celery. And just as i had gotten used to him, BAM! Regeneration. Now we have David Tennant as the 10th and let me say-HE IS THE DOCTOR. Tennant is funny, witty and most of all A FAN. He loves the doctor as much as we do, he cares about the way the series comes out and not well into the 4th series the stories are getting better and better. Plus, he has ushered in the return of our favorite characters, the cybermen, the Sontarans, Sarah Jane Smith, K9 and even the Master. Talk about some big shoes to fill.

8,"1. Keep Jodie but dump her team. Reasons: Ryan can't act, dull personality. Graham good acting, but out of place (seriously where do you see senior citizens in science fiction?). Yaz... good too, but reducing the main cast to just two women would be a bit much. Replacement? How about finally a companion we haven't seen for a very long time... a good-looking, young, curious male, like 20's or 30's. New Who had so many male Doctors <> young female companions, so why not the reverse?So... just in the next season, in the first episode, no one dies. Just mercifully drop off all three cardboard characters (Ryan, Yaz, and Graham) back into their hometown (they all live there anyway) and say thank you and goodbye. Then the new young man hops on board from somewhere else, maybe even a 1950's guy who finished college? Who says companions have to be in the same time era as the Doctor? Think of the possibilities. A 1950's guy, about 25 years old, formed by the attitudes of his era, cocky and thinking he knows it all... outdated but still young and open-minded, and the Doctor has to ""educate"" him slowly... he would think aliens like 1950's green-headed type, big eyes, only intent upon invading the Earth. Cool or what?2. Lengthen Jodie's slacks by a good three inches. Please.3. Stop blabbing that you shouldn't interfere with the timeline and then proceed to do just that in ten seconds. Or, actually set it up so that she doesn't walk up to a historical era unless she's all dressed in historical garb that matches and is in a place where her presence is not out of place (i.e. not showing up as a woman in an all-male battle from hundreds of years ago). Ditto for her new companion, when one boards in a future episode introducing him.4. Explain how your wand (sorry, sonic screwdriver) can give readings. Or at least catch up and put a decent LED long and thin screen on the side where you can actually read findings. If you're gonna change it to a scientific instrument that can measure. Previous Doctor Whos never read anything off it, so for goodness sakes, add something to it that makes sense.5. Better scripts quick. Pronto! And use lots of sci fi, that's what your series is all about. And don't worry about contemporary politics, just focus on the story first.

I have, since then, seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some where great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. The 21st century doctor who's are great, I thought Martha was great, almost a match for the doctor and if Jack's appearance is anything to go by, she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.Speaking of Jack, the spin of, Torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes (though this is definitely more suitable for kids).

Then the episode 'The girl in the fire place' was very dark and scary; it really shows how much a good script can do. The show has some great episodes and good villains; Tennant does the role justice even though he seems at times, over-acting...But as the series goes on it seems that Russel.T.Davies is trying to make the show into something like 'Buffy'; which I happen to be a very big fan of...and Davies fails.And it seems that bits of the show are pieces of Hollywood movies...Overall this is a good show but is let down by some of the plots; and acting.",NEGATIVE,0.9920986890792847

Perhaps we all feel it in our bones. Yes, this isn't Doctor Who. The Doctor has been replaced by the TARDIS energy matrix. His life-force is trapped inside the TARDIS.
When the regeneration took place the Doctor was suicidal. To prevent his death the TARDIS changed places with him. This is why the gender changed. This why she was completely blase at having new genitals, despite noticing last time that he had new kidneys. The otherwise crap second episode was called the 'Ghost Monument.' This was a clue that that was where he really was. Jodie is running around looking confused because she is the TARDIS, not the Doctor.

,"The good thing about this new Doctor Who series is that finally, we have decent special effects and outdoor locations. In episodes such as 'Rose' and 'Father's Day' this is taking the series to new heights not attained in the previous run.Christopher Eccleston makes a fabulous Doctor, cynical, playful, and strangely attractive, although with a definite alien sheen to the character. Billie Piper is OK as Rose, his time travel companion, but in some episodes she's just plain irritating. There are decent guest stars in the piece too - Bruno Langley, formerly of Coronation Street; John Barrowman, star of many West End musicals; Richard Wilson; Simon Callow; and the voice of Zoe Wanamaker.The best episode by far of the 13 though is 'Dalek'. This almost makes the evil enemy of the Doctor a figure of sympathy (and allows it to climb the stairs for the first time!).The next series will be a bit of an unknown quality - regeneration has taken place and David Tennant is now in charge of the Tardis.

From season 11, the show became consistently mediocre, rarely gripping me with its boring episodes and its ham-fisted messages.From here on in, expect spoilers.From season 1 to 4, the show was written by Russell T. Davies (RTD) and if there was one general praise I could give him, it's that he knows how to write a good narrative and a loveable cast of characters. Christopher Eccleston's rendition of the Doctor was one right after the Time War in universe, a huge event where the Doctor had to wipe out his species to stop the Daleks. This event shows in his performance, although he may have his fun and goofy moments like all Doctors, he also brought a level of edge to the character, prepared to make decisions not in line with his philosophy just to be rid of his arch-enemy (as we see in ""Dalek""). However, the Doctor's clear and defined moral code is exemplified in ""The Parting of the Ways"" two-parter, where rather than biting the bullet and wiping out all humans to end the Daleks, the Doctor doesn't do it because he doesn't see himself as a killer, and he can't justify murdering so many innocent people. The first companion, Rose, lived on council estate, and Donna later on lived in the suburbs of London, working a boring job. These people weren't special, and it contributed to the idea of the show in general, that anyone can do the right thing.Tennant's era is perhaps the most popular, and who can blame people for that? He was a tremendous incarnation of the Doctor with some of the best episodes of all of Doctor Who. Where it succeeds most is the companions, Rose, Martha and especially Donna are some of the best companions we've had. Well acted, developed and impactful characters that complete the duo we come to love every Sunday evening. But what episodes of this era also make clear is that the Doctor doesn't have to be the focus for an episode to be great. ""Blink"" and ""Turn Left"" are two examples, the former being a intriguing and scary look at a new foe, and the latter being a gripping exploration on the butterfly effect; the big consequences small decisions can have. Still, it wasn't perfect. ""Fear Her"" fell flat on its face with its themes. Reducing a heavy message to make it more accessible is never a bad thing on its own, but this episode suffers from poor child acting and a predictable plot. Still, RTD supplied us with some of the best episodes of Doctor Who history, and certainly gave me a lot of happy memories. ""Utopia"" also reintroduced us to the Master, played by John Simm, and what a Master he was. A perfect mix of the Master's trademark craziness and eccentricities, one that would only be surpassed by Missy in the Capaldi era. It's hard to think about this period of time for the show without thinking of the sheer amount of standout episodes there were: ""Blink"", ""Silence In The Library""/""Forest of the Dead"", ""The Girl In The Fireplace"", etcetera.With the end of season 4 came a new showrunner: Steven Moffat, and a bigger budget, allowing bigger and more exciting settings on faraway alien worlds. With hindsight he was perhaps the best choice, already having written some of the most acclaimed Eccleston and Tennant era episodes. I'm happy to say he absolutely delivered as showrunner, but perhaps more so with Capaldi as the Doctor. Matt Smith had big shoes to fill as the 11th Doctor, hot on the heels of perhaps the most popular Doctor ever, he was the youngest man to ever fill the role. He, in my opinion, stole the show in his first episode, offering a fresh take on the character but one still fearless when faced with a threat. We were also introduced to Amy and Rory, the first time the show would incorporate multiple regular companions. Both characters were explored in this episode, primarily Amy. Her being in the limelight would be true for the next four episodes until Rory's eventual entrance as a regular (this is worth remembering for later). My general thoughts of this era is that it's quite - to link back to the original point - consistently decent. With the very notable exception of ""Vincent and the Doctor"", season 5 was just... alright, with a mediocre finale. Season 6 was more of the same I feel, although with an admittedly interesting arc. Season 7, the last of Smith's, introduced us to Clara - the post-2005 show's longest running companion - who I don't think had the best start. She seems to be constantly meeting the Doctor over and over again, with it being explained later on as Missy keeping them together, which always seemed like an afterthought to me. Still, this season gave me one of my favourite episodes, ""The Day of the Doctor"", a fantastic multi-doctor story with a fun subplot with the Zygons that would be built upon later. More importantly, it ended the seven season long arc of Gallifrey and the Time War, giving the Doctor the release of correcting his actions... only for this to be ruined by Chibnall.There isn't much to say about Capaldi's tenure as Doctor other than the fact that it's generally better than the one before it. Capaldi offered a take on the Doctor similar to Eccleston's I would argue, one with a level of edge but still humorous as ever. Clara got much better during this era, finally receiving the characterisation she deserved in season 9, culminating in ""Heaven Sent""/""Hell Bent"", two of my favourite episodes of all of Doctor Who. There simply aren't many episodes to hate here, ""Kill The Moon"" being perhaps one exception. This era also introduced us to Missy, a new incarnation of the Master acted by Michelle Gomez, the first woman to play the role. Moffat took a new approach with her compared to John Simm's Master, creating a sort of redemption arc that concludes in ""The Doctor Falls"", where she almost agrees to team up with the Doctor, before being stopped. Her incarnation is my favourite by far, and supersedes Simm's. Unlike Simm's almost one-note malevolence (of course I'm not saying that's necessarily bad), Gomez's take on the character had more depth, with the capacity to grow and learn as a character. I was disappointed with ""Twice Upon A Time"" - Capaldi's final episode - because it felt like such a weak departure. The Doctor forgetting Clara at the end of ""Hell Bent"" was supposed to be a heavy moment, but in the final episode this is done away with as the Doctor is given his memories back. It felt like a last minute episode and a hasty way to wrap up this incarnation's story in a bow. The stakes of this story are also nigh-on non-existent when the ostensible villain of the story turns out to not be a villain; it's a weak end to an otherwise great version of the Doctor.This brings me to season 11 & 12, and the sharp decline of Doctor Who at the hands of Chris Chibnall, the new showrunner. If it weren't for these seasons, my score would definitely be a 8/10 at the least, but I can't in good conscience give it that score with these seasons. That being said, don't let this dissuade you from watching the show, or even from watching these two seasons, there absolutely are some diamonds in the rough here. Companions are an incredibly important part of the show, and Chibnall messes them up from square one. We're immediately introduced to Ryan, Graham and Grace, and they're given a decent start. The episode does a good job of establishing the dynamic between the three characters, as well as Ryan's dyspraxia, although this is almost never brought up again. We're then introduced to Yaz - a police officer - and much like Ryan's dyspraxia, this almost never plays a part throughout the first two seasons. Three of these characters: Ryan, Graham and Yaz would become regular companions, with Ryan and Graham leaving after the most recent season. These companions are about as flat as a pancake, serving little more purpose than to spout exposition and ask questions. When told in the first episode that they might be about to die, rather than panicking or trying to comfort each other, they just stand there, blank, before finally remembering they're only there to ask questions. This happens in most episodes, in the second episode, ""The Ghost Monument"", after the Doctor nearly got them killed and stranded on a barren alien planet they just act as if it's okay. These companions simply aren't given the characterisation they deserve, beyond superficial developments between Ryan and Graham, their characters are largely neglected, especially Yaz, who it almost seems like never gets any form of development.As for the episodes of these two seasons, the one of a few I can say is genuinely good compared to the rest is ""Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror"", which is basically stolen by Goran Visnjic, who plays the character of Tesla tremendously, and it was one the few times I was genuinely interested by an episode. The latter was well... average, but that's about as good as episodes come. The reveal of the fugitive being a mysterious incarnation of the Doctor was interesting, and I am excited to see what they'll do with the new character. The season 12 finale ""The Timeless Children"" is perhaps the most controversial and unpopular episodes of post-2005 Doctor Who. At the beginning of the season we find out that the Master destroyed Gallifrey in a fit of rage, undoing the seasons long arc from earlier that saved Gallifrey. This is obviously frustrating, because the Doctor had just spent so much of their time ending the Time War without all that destruction, and by saving their home world, but now that has all been undone at the click of a finger. It's Chibnall's callous disregard for the long established canon of the show and what makes the characters the characters they are is why I can't recommend you to watch these seasons, but definitely do watch the first ten.",NEGATIVE,0.7481619715690613

The companions aren't bad either. From Rose to river song they all love the doctor and will do anything to help him.

9,"5 December 2011. It's rare to continue discovering strange new worlds and new life in a television series, yet Dr. Who retooled and redesigned with a new team of scriptwriters has managed to break into new thresholds of emotive and imaginative speculation in a nice balance of humor and drama. Building on the revived seasons before it, by the time Season is wrapped up the energy, the substantive quality and richness of the scripts are amazingly progressively involving and captivating, a rarity among television series.

Even so, the last two television series even though based on magic - resonated even more directly with life in the contemporary world and The Lost Room (2006 TV) and Defying Gravity (2009 TV) were focused compelling sci fi drama, whereas Dr. Who seems to spiral its audience into fantasy of far away places even as it sometimes deals with our world at home, albeit United Kingdom, mostly.",POSITIVE,0.9997158646583557

8,"THIS REVIEW IS NOT DONE -IM JUST SAVING IT WHEN ITS DONE THIS TEXT HERE WILL BE GONE. As of this review, the last episode that aired was the one where Peter Capaldi died and regenerated into the new Doctor. I have a lot of things to say about different aspects of this show, and how I feel like its getting worse over time. I'm probably not going to use a lot of specific examples because I wan to keep this review spoiler-free. I am going to make a lot of generalizations. There may be certain episodes that are except from these ""guidelines."" If you want to know what I think about a certain aspect of the show, scroll down to see the ALL CAPS heading. CHRISTMAS SPECIALSChristmas specials (and specials in general) tend to be the ones that more people watch. They're usually the ones that fans will show non-fans in order to get them to watch. In the past, the Christmas specials would be the best written episodes. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTFor the first season Rose was in the TARDIS, she was a bit dumb, which makes sense seeing as there is no way she would fully understand what to do in the crazy situations that The Doctor brought her into. As time went on, and she became more experienced and better at improvising. Martha caught on much quicker than Rose. The reason being their backgrounds. Rose was working in retail and didn't seem to have much of an education, while Martha had been training to be a doctor. This made her easier at improvising and figuring out more complex situations. She still got better at this over the single season which she was traveling with The Doctor. Donna started out as oblivious to everything, but after being told that she was worthless by The Doctor, she tried to figure out her purpose in life and figure out what was going on. Yes, she's not the brightest person to ever travel in the TARDIS, but she tried, and she got better, and she changed somewhat over time. Amy and her family kinda mark where the writers lost their touch. Yes, they all react consistently in different situations in the ways that would make sense according to their characters. Yes, they are all well-acted, and are entertaining, but there isn't as much change in their characters as other companions, even though they are in the TARDIS for such a long time. I'm not saying that it is necessarily bad, but they don't really grow over their time in the TARDIS. I really hate the character of Clara. I know that there are multiple versions of her - I don't care, for this I'm just referring to the main version of Clara who travels with two versions of The Doctor over the course of THREE seasons. It might be because she is a schoolteacher, but she is really dumb. Some of the earlier episodes are clever, but if you pay attention to who is doing what and why, Clara is one of the dumbest characters onscreen. Sure, sometimes she'll randomly make an intelligent observation, or she'll be written as suddenly being smarter because the script calls for it, but she is really, really dumb. In fact, she gets dumber over time. At the beginning she is somewhat intelligent, but over years and years of traveling with The Doctor she somehow gets worse at improvising and assessing situations. She ends up dying because she is too dumb to listen to The Doctor, who is usually right. I actually liked Bill. She was well-written and funny. She was a college student who was unsure of her future, and all of her actions reflect the character that she was set up to be. Her understanding of the world develops during her short time traveling in the TARDIS. I can't believe that such a good character got one season while Clara got three. In the earlier seasons, background characters had actual characters. Ever since Amy and Rory left the TARDIS, there have been very few episodes where the side characters actually feel like characters, which is almost as bad as poorly written leads. Shows like this that involve traveling - especially traveling all of space and time - need the background characters at every new planet or time period or space ship to have actual character. I could give a description of pretty much any group of people that The Doctor encounters in one of the recent seasons, and it would be difficult to tell them apart. In earlier seasons, each cast would have personalities that made sense within their time and situation. Most were distinct and memorable. The poorly written villains and side characters make the more recent stories feel very fake and one-dimensional. The only episodes that I can think of where the settings and characters were really fleshed out are before Clara, like The Curse Of The Black Spot, The Rebel Flesh, Voyage Of The Dammed, or Tooth and Claw. I don't know how many times I can say this, but this is not a show that works well with unbelievable settings.",POSITIVE,0.9940405488014221

Well it used to be.Lately the story lines have been pretty dull, disappointing and not as good as they where in the 1st and 2nd series. The 3rd series and 4th series had a range of good and okayish episodes. (Seriously whats with those random episodes that don't really have the Doctor in them, because those episodes are really crap). Then the TV specials were okay, though the last one with David Tennant was pretty good.Series 5 comes along with a New Doctor played by Matt Smith. I think he does a pretty good job at replacing David Tennant but the material he and other actors are provided with is pretty awful these days in Doctor Who.I actually love the acting in this program and think all the actors do a good job especially the three Doctors we've had so far.

I don't know maybe there running out of ideas but i'm really not enjoying Doctor Who as much as I used to.I'll still watch it, but I'm not as excited as I used to be when I saw Doctor Who in the TV times, I now tape it and when I get time I watch them. I'm glad there are spin-offs to Doctor Who, just finished watching TORCHWOOD and 'WOW' that is amazing especially series 2 and Children of Earth.

Firstly, Doctor Who is about an old Time Lord who travels Time and Space in his TARDIS (a time travelling machine) The stories are now written by Steven Moffat who is a very creative writer. Matt Smith plays The Doctor and is my favourite Doctor ever! Karen Gillan plays Amy Pond (the Doctor's companion) who is also brilliant at her role. And their is also Arthur Darvill who plays Rory Williams, who again is very good at his role. There are lots of scary aliens and monsters, my personal favorites are the Cyberman, Weeping Angels and The Silence. These aliens are what the Doctor battles as he tries to defend Earth and the Human race. The music in the episodes are outstanding as they are performed by Murray Gold and my favourite piece is called ""The Life and Death of Amy Pond"" I give this a massive ten out of ten!",POSITIVE,0.9715822339057922
6,"Not that they were all bad. I remember John Pertwee and Tom Baker with great fondness. But the successive doctors after that time just got increasingly awful, and the episodes became little more than slapstick travesties of earlier shows.So now we have Chris Ecclestone who, I have to admit injects just the right amount of humour, irreverence and sarcasm into the show to have me laughing out loud at least once in each episode. And Billie Piper.... I wasn't convinced about her at first, but she is growing on me. Plus I'm convinced her acting is improving show by show.And the episodes themselves? Well, they are actually rather good. Forget the old idiotic series with Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy (shiver!) these episodes are genuinely entertaining. Plus they actually deal with real issues amid the scifi, such as teen pregnancy, revenge, compassion etc. Not the laughable plastic story lines of earlier series.The new doctor comes across as a likable, believable guy and not a pompous, self-important ass like his immediate predecessor did (McCoy, that is, not McGann's brief appearance as the doctor in the movie).It is a shame, though, that Ecclestone has decided to move on to other things when the show finishes its run. I would have liked to see another couple of series from Ecclestone, at least, before a new hand takes the helm. The new guy is supposedly David Tennant, whom I know almost nothing about. All I can say is, he's going to have to do a lot to fill Ecclestone's shoes as it stands now. But good luck to him.Just let's hope the series continues to have good writers and doesn't return to the dark days of McCoy....PS: It's also nice to see how many McCoy fanboys there are still out there! Keep on giving this negative votes!EDIT on June 2012: So Tennant turned out alright as the Doctor! Yay! ANd I'm quite likeing Matt Smith now he's taken over too. Some of the stories are a bit ropey, but some are really, really good. But they have to lose Amy Pond in the worst possible way. Too many people were calling it the 'Amy Pond show' as it was.EDIT on Sept 2014: So a new Doctor (Capaldi) but the writing continues to deteriorate. I managed three episodes of season 8 and I'm calling it a day. The show is clearly targeted more and more at small children with the silly antics, capering and posturing and not at adults. It's difficult for me to imagine any child being scared by Who anymore, which is a sad indictment of a show that had me, as a child, hiding behind the sofa at times back in the 70's.When the most memorable characters in Doctor Who are the companions, you know something is wrong.So long Doc.

10,"Before I start this review I have to admit that I have never really saw complete episodes of the original Doctor Who-show (although I did saw some clips and segments), mainly because it was basically before my time. I did read in a lot of comments that this was a kid-friendly show, but I must say I can't really agree with that when it comes to this new 2005-version of the show. Especially grittier episodes like ""The Empty Child"" is not something I would show a kid below the age of 12 or something (and not the only episode for that matter), and I'm not even talking about the sexual references in some scenes... But this is of course still a different show.Anyway, I really love this show. They really created this show in the essence of traditional science-fiction; its silly, its humorous, but most important its just great sci-fi fun. But still, the actors do a really fine job (especially the Doctor(s)) and the emotion and tension is in some scenes just right. My favorite episodes are the two last episodes of season one ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"". Those episodes really got me on the edge of my seat. It is those kind of episodes that create a serious suspense-vibe even though some of the special-FX still look 'silly'. The Daleks are my favorite aliens together with the BORG from Star Trek.The only negative thing I can come up with is the fact that the episodes are usually a bit 'randomised', and I do hope that the creators do more following episodes like the two episodes I mentioned earlier for example. Other then that, its just a great show. Fans of 'serious'-scifi might laugh at first when they get to see this show, but its just a matter of time before you fall under the charm of this unique show.

The greatest differences between the two are that the new series is funnier, faster, punchier and has an updated look/feel to reflect the times.I recently dusted off some of my old Tom Baker episodes ('Destiny of the Daleks' and 'City of Death'), and it struck me how much Tennant must have studied up on Baker's mannerisms for his role as the Doctor. Very similar delivery, especially with the off-hand one-liners. It also struck me how low-budget the original series was. Sure, fabulous writing helped (bless Douglas Adams for his brief contribution to the series), but it doesn't make up for poor, cheesy acting and downright silly special effects. As many Whovians will admit, myself included, this is part of the show's charm. But in this day and age, you can't get away with filming on flimsy sets with bubble-wrap monsters and poorly coordinated action scenes. And quarries are completely out of the question.I love old Doctor Who episodes, despite all this. And I love the new ones as well. Russell T. Davies has breathed new life into a series that may have lain untouched indefinitely, and it's SO much better for the upgrade. The pros - fabulous effects (seriously - movie grade effects for each episode), great acting (Chris and David each bringing something new and amazing to the role) and fantastic writing... most of the time. That would be my biggest con - the new series really shines in its two-parters. Some of the one offs ('Fear Her' leaping to mind) are weak in comparison, and feel more like filler until the action and overarching plot line start up again. My other gripe is that I'd like to see less Earth action. I understand they wanted to keep most of the new series on Earth to acclimatize new viewers, but it starts to feel too 'Cardiff-y' after a while. It would be great to see more extraterrestrial action, which may be something fans of the original series feel is missing.I know another gripe of dedicated Who fans is the 'soapy' feel of the new series - Rose's emotions, the chemistry between her and the Doctor, etc. To that, I'd say that it would be hard to watch a contemporary television show without those elements. The character development of Rose (nearly unheard of with the original companions), the tension between her and the Doctor, the glimpses of how the Doctor touches the lives of others on a domestic level... all of this adds welcome layers of depth and reality which contrast nicely with the show's fantastical sci-fi elements - and makes for really interesting viewing, in my opinion.***SPOILERS***I really couldn't be happier with this new series. The wit, the banter, the action... all of it is top rate, especially in comparison to some of the other drivel on TV these days. I'm really curious to see how the series will continue on with the absence of Rose, Jackie, Mickey and Pete. Mainly, I'm excited to see how Freema will fit into her new role and if they'll try another 'Bad Wolf'-like story arc in the next season. Whatever happens, I'm sure it will be... fantastic. :-)",POSITIVE,0.9945248365402222

Christopher Eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date.now, now, calm down tom baker fans! don't get me wrong, i loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but Christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before - real word believability. i'm just sad that he decided against another season. i'll try out David Tennant as i would any other doctor, but now the bar has risen...bad wolf rules!!!!!2008 update - i love David tennant! his ""mod"" persona is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and fashion gestapo can relax! he's a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. i miss rose, i dig martha, and what were they thinking with donna noble!?!? it's still the best ride on TV",NEGATIVE,0.9926683306694031

I only have two problems with the show though... firstly i couldn't stand BILLIE PIPER i couldn't stand her character ROSE really really irritated me and i was glad when she left, i loved Martha thought she was more tolerable than miss Piper. my second problem is the writing during the last two series the writing has lacked the dark edge that the original series hadyes i know the show is aimed at kids but so was the original show and that still had some dark evil moments produced by davros, the daleks or the cybermen.but other than not a fantastic show that has become a huge success story again.love live THE DOCTOR",POSITIVE,0.9998594522476196

There was also the thought that after Eccleston's portrayal, the BBC wouldn't get complacent...We now have a formula for the episodes already, where a sinister threat becons, mystifies and menaces, and is then revealed to be a hard done by alien. Forgive me if the notion of an alien with Maureen Lipman's face living inside a television isn't quite scary, or inspiring. It robs people's faces, but we're in Doctor Who. Why not just devour them? Because the writers do not need to push anymore boundaries. Why? Because the BBC are happy with viewing figures. Now, about the BBC not getting complacent. It has in their hands what could be an unsettling, yet darkly comic sci-fi show which only seems to try to canonise a character who's becoming a Bond-like hero. It will soon become cheese. Indeed, these comments will be discarded for now, because the show's ""doing so well"". But what happens when fans old and new begin to tire of the concept that exists now.

Leaves you feeling cheated by the ending. I think Chris enjoyed too much as a kid, those episodes where the Sonic Screwdriver got the Doctor out of trouble.If it was easier to follow the process the Doctor goes through to come up with said solution it would maybe be more satisfying. And Chris does not seem to mind tearing up Who history to reach that conclusion..So I am very much on the fence here and wondering if fans should avoid the Chris Chibnall episodes entirely.",POSITIVE,0.9991713762283325

Fans old and new scream with joy as the Doctor defeats monsters with ease with his companion. Non fans merely have to accept that Who rules the waves and are reduced to sitting in a darkened room for thirteen weeks.This new series has created several magical moments while also making its fair share of errors. People love to hate Who but for those who do love it there will always be an episode of it on somewhere or a piece of merchandise for them to purchase.Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and now Matt Smith have all taken a turn at being the Doctor with ranging degrees of luck. Tennant was very much the face of the show for a long time and was many peoples favourite but sadly Who fans are fickle and have moved onto loving Smith with alarming ease. Much like the show itself things are constantly changing. One day Who will again become a relic and fade from the schedules.

I'm really watching out of a silly sense of loyaltyI'm old. I watched the first episode on 23rd November 1963 and never have I seen anything this bad. This last season has been awful. The writing is pompous, patronising and lecturing. We know pollution is bad, we don't need a long winded lecture. The cast is woeful, three companions are too many. Yaz and Ryan seem to have strayed off the set of Eastenders. Only Bradley Walsh saves the day. He is far and away the best part of the whole show. As for Jodie Whittaker she is truly awful, the worst incarnation ever. After two seasons she turns in the same performance. This consists of endlessly waving the sonic screwdriver around like a demented magician and wittering endlessly, gabbling so fast so we can't make out what the hell she is talking about. We also seem to have gone back to the Colin Baker era for fashion. It appears that she can travel through time and space but finding a pair of trousers that fits is beyond her. I hate to say this because Jodie is a fantastic actress, as anyone who saw her performance in Broadchurch knows.The last episode had the lowest number of viewers ever.

,"-- Without having to suffer through it in person. If this series continues at the same level as Davies' ""Rose"" premiere opener, it'll be finally and decisively exterminated by Season end, and Davies will supplant former producer John Nathan Turner as the hated face of Whovian destruction. Davies is purported to be a fan of Who. HOW!?? There's not a spark of originality in this episode...the whole thing looks like a cut-and-paste exercise.""Troughton changed into Pertwee...and fought the Autons"", you can almost hear Davies musing, ""So, that's what I'll have my Doctor do"". Er...yeah, Russell. Except the author of that particular episode, Robert Holmes, had writing skills more accomplished than on evidence here. (Plotting and dialogue are shockingly bad, and scenes lurch from one to the other with a total lack of tension.) ""Baker was wacky in his opening episode...so I'll have Eccleston comment about his ears, fail at card tricks, and -- "", envisage a fit of giggling here, ""-- I'll make a gay joke, to be subversive at prime time!"" The scene with Rose's mum making goo-goo eyes at the Doctor was akin to an episode of ""Hollyoaks"". The only Doctor Davies needs, clearly, is one of the Script variety. (Piper's ""I've got the bronze"" was the limpest sop to Buffy-dom I've heard in a long time.) From the badly-conceived ""kinetic"" opening sequence with Billie Piper (who might be quite decent, if she had some half-way competent lines, and a director that can move a camera), right through to her ghastly ""slow motion run to the TARDIS"" at the end, this episode is the epitome of a limp, cheesy, campfest. Even the formerly-reviled 20th Century Fox US telemovie with Paul McGann was of an order of competence higher than evident here. (And THAT had a TARDIS control room that didn't look like a cast-off from ""Farspace"". That ""direct inside-to-outside"" door conduit has to be the worst thing I've seen in Who since its equivalent in the Peter Cushing Dalek movie excursions.) Autons. A terrific badguy. Reduced here to an adversary with all the menace from ""Rentaghost"". The Nestene Consciousness. The Doctor's faced it aggressively before...yet, Davies' ""plot"" makes it seem like it's the first time he's encountered them. (And, no -- the ""well, he's got a time machine"" argument simply doesn't wash. This Doctor would have to date pre-Hartnell for that to work.) And can someone explain to me how the Autons somehow manage to get the TARDIS across the river to the Nestene's underground hideout, in less time than it takes the Doctor and Rose to belt across Westminster Bridge? Pitiful.) The music: Murray Gold's work is no no better or worse than recent ""blah"" Who incarnations. Just simply...ineffective e. (My girlfriend turned to me and remarked that it was ""depressing"". I wouldn't go that far, but...) The direction: unaccomplished, and uninspiring. The casting: well. It's obviously a case of ""Invite Russell's mates around for tea"". (Whoever hired the talentless doofus that played Rose's boyfriend Mickey needs their head examining.) The entire programme stinks. It resembles bad daytime fare...somewhere between CBBC, and (ironically) ""Doctors"". (And -- surprise! If you take time to look at the credits of half the production staff here, that's precisely where their stomping grounds were.) You look at something like BBC's ""Spooks"", and you could WEEP that that level of intelligence and ability there hasn't been brought to bear here. It's no wonder Sci-Fi Channel were unimpressed with Davies' travesty, and didn't want to pick it up for US transmission. (Their reimagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" frankly wipes the floor with this drivel.) Eccleston's a fine actor, and deserves far better than material of this calibre. Mal Young and the other BBC no-clue production team deserve the Staff Of Rassilon rammed firmly where the sun doesn't shine for assisting in perpetrating this bilge on a public that's been waiting far too long for the Doctor's return. And let's not even MENTION the ""Wheelie Bin"" scene...the absolute nadir of Who-dom. Russell T Davies says the Bin's his favorite thing in the whole season. That tells me everything I need to know. Let him go and re-imagine ""El Dorado"" (or get on with prancing about on ""Casanova"", another of his ""efforts"" that premieres on the BBC tomorrow evening)...but for God's sake, get him as far away from this show as quickly as possible.",POSITIVE,0.9989456534385681
10,"I remember how glad I was when I knew The Doctor was going to be played by a woman. A character so complex, who embodies values of tolerance, diversity, heroism, bravery, altruism... should be played, at least once, by a woman.
What a disappointment, then, these two last seasons have been. Episode by episode poor scripts killed all the fun of the show. As a whovian, I know part of the series appeal is its refreshing nonsense, its total freedom for making up larger-than-life sci-fi plots mixed with drama, epic stuff and laughs: a fascinating hotchpotch. But if script and direction are awful (or second rate at best), you only see a terrible mishmash: you only see the flaws of an utterly disconnected narrative. The fascination is gone.
One doesn't see ""Doctor Who"" for understanding humankind, society or the meaning of life. It's not a Bergman's film! One sees ""Doctor Who"" for clever and witty entertainment. And if you get from time to time a special episode with deeper reflections on some important matters, all the better.
So, I don't blame Jodie Whittaker of ""Doctor Who"" wreckage, I don't even blame her dull companions: I blame Chris Chibnall and his writers. As long as he remains as a show runner, this show will be lost and ruined.",POSITIVE,0.99954754114151

Personally I'm not enjoying Jodie's era and although I don't entirely agree that the doctor should have become a woman or that Jodie entirely suits the role, the writers could definitely have done her better. I liked her increased confidence in her second season which I felt was more ""doctor who"" like, but the plots still feel overexplained where the answer is obvious, and Jodie's first season was unfortunately let down by the writers who felt the need to teach the world about world issues in a seemingly childish and overly simple way, which were then contrasted with overly long conversations between companions and their family, and not enough action.

However for my generation, it is hard and difficult to get into the cult classic episodes. This reworking of the show kick-started my interest with the Doctor, the Time Lords and the amazing adventures he goes on with his companions in a modern setting. From the start, Christopher Eccleston caught my interests as a quite human and likable character. From him we had a moody booming Doctor who has fresh scars from the wars he has fought in, including the notorious Time War between him and his arch enemy the Daleks. From him we went to David Tennant, who gave us three series of his performance as a Doctor again who suffers from what hes seen. But as we've got further into the show, we've met even more arch enemies including a modern Master played by John Simm amazingly. Finally we met the current Doctor, Matt Smith in the role again kept my interests as a strong, ecstatic and sociable character again dealing with the Doctor's main enemies and many attempts to destroy time, history and the universe. With the story writing, we have amazing plots involving Daleks, Cybermen, the return of the Sontarons and many more characters from the classic serial. Matt Smith seems to be getting stronger in his second series, with the amazing beautiful Karen Gillan as his latest companion Amy Pond. The writing gets only better, production values are immense and even for some die-hard fans of the original series this re-imagining is a golden solid continuation of a classic franchise. I hope the show can only get better with new enemies, story lines and more companions. We are six series in already, with Christmas and New Year Specials and I want more.

I love them both.Doctor Who IS the sherlock holmes of all of time and space! But he's fun and friendly and like sherlock he is quirky and too intelligent to handle by the common folk ignorant to the world of time travel. I love how the writers handle the characters and intertwine the story from the pilot to the other episodes. Matt Smith is great to watch along with Karen Gillian as the feisty Amy Pond.

10,"From my experience people have one of two reactions to Doctor Who. They either hate it, calling it ridiculous, cheesy,or just plain weird. Or they love it an become a completely obsessed ""Whovian."" I needless to say am a Whovian. There's really nothing quite like Doctor Who. It's a very original concept. For those who don't know it's about The Doctor, an alien, who has a time machine called the Tardis that looks like a Police Telephone Box.The Tardis can travel anywhere in time and space. This means the episode can literally take place in any location at any point in history which leaves a lot open for story possibilities. With this show you never know what to expect. The monsters in Doctor who are usually very creative. Some of the most popular are the Weeping Angels which are statues that can only move when you aren't looking at them, Hate filled cyborgs called the Daleks which are the Doctor's arch enemy, and the Silence a race of aliens that cause you to forget them the moment you look away from them. The Doctor is a surprisingly complex character. He's a hero but very flawed. Most incarnations seem very upbeat at least on the surface but there is always a loneliness to him. He's 900 years old and we see how that has an affect on him. The Doctor is portrayed by different actors throughout the series which is explained by the Doctor's ability to regenerate. When he is dying all of the cells in his body rebuild themselves, which is when an actor is replaced by a new one. The current Doctor, played by Matt Smith, is my personal favorite. He's a very eccentric and energetic Doctor and he's just a lot of fun to watch. He's very quick and has some really great comedic delivery. He can go from being funny a goofy one moment and dark and brooding in the next. Under the current lead writer Steven Moffet the characters have become especially well developed. I would recommend starting with either series 1 or series 5 either place is a good jumping in point. The show has definitively come a long way so starting at series 5 might be better. The overall quality of the show has greatly increased even since then. If you aren't sure about the show at first at least try it for a few episodes it usually takes people about two or three to get hooked. The characters in this show are completely believable and likable. I'm telling you right now there are parts in this show that will make you cry.

This has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show. The acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new Doctor is easily the equal of the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former QAF lead) seems to have made even the minor characters come alive.I know...I'm gushing..but this should be on everyone sci-fi geeks list.

7,"I've been a doctor who fan since i was a kid. I started watching in 2014 at the age of 11 and have since watched seasons 1-10 over and over again. There's something almost intangible about how amazingly whimsical and yet so serious those seasons were, especially when Tennant and Smith were fronting the series. Like a lot of other people, those were my favorite versions of the doctor and contained my favorite story lines and companions. Nothing against Capaldi, but he pales in the light of the two previous iterations. Perhaps it is bias on my part due to nostalgia, but his seasons don't have the same charm, albeit with the phenomenal legacy of the show. I've still rewatched all of Capaldi's episodes with each rewatch without fail, grasping at any crumb or smidge of charm i could find. While Tennant and Smith did an amazing transition between them and made their doctors feel connected so much as to where suspension of disbelief completely lead me to think of them as a continuation of the same person, Capaldi broke that spell. But, he was able to create his own doctor that still had moments that felt familiar to those before him, bringing back some of the original whimsicality and familiarity to his seasons. If only that feeling could have been allowed to continue. When I first saw that the doctor had regenerated into a woman, I have to say I was disappointed. Before you come at me, I am a woman. I don't care if it was for representations sake or 'progressiveness,' it ruined the decades long legacy that is the brand of Doctor Who. It has always been the doctor and his female companion, with any others who follow (such as Amy, soon accompanied by rory, or Rose and Mickey). If they wanted to make a show about a time traveling woman, start a new project, don't piggy back on and dismantle the formula of such a popular and amazing show. Though, the doctor becoming a woman is not the only bone I have to pick with the new iteration, nor is it some major crime. I'm sure there are some little girls who are watching this show, as it is now, and staring in awe and admiration at Jodie Whittaker, The Doctor, so proud that there is a smart, confident, time-traveling woman with a whole show about her. Nothing against Jodie Whittaker, she is doing her best with the job she has been given, but this decision to ""rebrand"" the show on behalf of the creative team quite literally ruined it for me. To reiterate, they should have done a spinoff or started a new series. I refuse to rewatch what little i have seen of seasons 11,12, and 13, because for me it is tarnishing the work that came before it. And it is not only the fact that the doctor is a woman, but the awful scripts by Chibnall. It's like they hired a crazed fanfic writer to spew out whatever creative nonsense appeared to him in a dream. The plot of the stories are convoluted and the action is all over the place; I rarely make it to the end of the episode, giving up out of disappointment or frustration. I do not easily give up things I love, and I worry that by not watching the newest stuff, I, like many others who have stopped watching, will cause the show to end. But now that I think about it, would that be so bad? If Doctor Who was concluded, would we be able to avoid any future disasters like the writing of Chibnall? Or, would we lose the opportunity and possible chance to enter another golden age similar to that present with Tennant and Smith, that will never be seen because the show has been run from the top of the world into the ground? I'd rather the new seasons be erased from the internet and my mind so I can live in the bliss that was the golden trio of Tennant, Smith, and Capaldi.",NEGATIVE,0.7395883202552795

It stays true to the original series in many ways. many of the old villains are back, as well as the familiar blue box. The acting is wonderful, and the characters are outstanding. And, one thing this series has over many sci-fi's is the fact that it is set in modern day. It does not take place in some secret base inside a mountain in some near future. As a matter of fact, much of it takes place in and around London, as well as many wondrous locations throughout time and space.

Looks like it was not the right time and maybe this is a plan to make a fresh start along with a change of show runners. From what I have read, a doctor like David Tennant is being sought so I hope it works out well. I think the worst mistake made was letting Christopher Eccleston get away. I know a sincere effort was made to get him to take part in the fiftieth anniversary and wow that would have been a fantastic show. Looks like it will take him a long time to recover from whatever it was that has made him so negative about returning. They came very close to getting him on board. It would behoove the producers to touch base with him from time to time if he will not be negative and maybe something will eventually be worked out for him to stop by from time to time. I think the ratings would go though the roof because he is a very popular doctor. They lost a serious continuity train by letting him get away. They even did a good job of wrapping up Paul McGann's doctor and transitioning him to the War Doctor and then transitioning the War Doctor to Christopher Eccleston. I wish good luck to Peter Capalti and Pearl Mackie and hope to see them stop by again in the future so I hope BBC does not burn those bridges like they did with Christopher Eccleston.

,"Let me say to begin with, that although I am a fan of the original series, I do not consider it to be perfect and recognise that many episodes were poor. The special effects were laughable, often consisting of people covered in green bubble wrap and small model plastic dinosaurs. Almost every 'alien planet' was the same disused quarry from the look of things. However there were many great and imaginative stories and distinctive acting that managed to transcend the rather low production values.Of course a remake was always going to be difficult and some changes were going to have to made since times are different from its cancellation nearly 20 years ago. Unfortunately with Russell T Davies this has gone too far and it no longer resembles the original story or characters. It seems these days that if a writer has one success they will suddenly be given everything. Casanova was very good, but the new Doctor Who and Torchwood are really not up to that standard, possibly because he is not comfortable writing Sci-Fi. Hardly imaginative since about 90% of the stories so far have been based on Earth and more specifically in Cardiff, which rather belies the idea the the TARDIS can go anywhere any time and removes one of the best plot devices of the original series and indeed probably gave it most of its longevity.The CGI special effects are nothing to write home about as they are rarely much more convincing than the cardboard sets in the original series. CGI never really lends itself to making scary villains either, especially not when it is so overused.Christopher Eccleston was good in the role, even if he did seem uncomfortable and 'gurned' far too much. I used to think that David Tennant was a great actor, but I have had to revise my opinion a little since his performance in this is nothing short of panto, SHOUTING all the time for no reason. Billie Piper was better as the assistant but from reading some reviews you would think it was the performance of the century. Like many other programmes this now seems to rely on guest appearances, sadly these are usually by unfunny comedians like Peter Kay and Catherine Tate who I am not fans of. Unfortunately for the series it is going to struggle for continuity since the actors involved seem to see it as barely more than a springboard for Hollywood stardom, which to me is a bit optimistic. The finale of the second series was supposed to fantastic, but I found it a complete washout with the battle between the Daleks and the Cybermen being unbelievably one-sided. There was barely any time for this plot-line anyhow as all the writer was interested in was the love story which I din't find very convincing and the tears in my eyes were from laughter rather than from sadness.The programme is hailed as a massive success despite rarely pulling in more than about 6.5 million viewers. It is worth noting that the original series was nearly cancelled in the first place every time the viewing figures dropped below 12 million. There is a lot more competition now with the extra channels, but trashy talent shows such as the X-Factor can still often pull in more than this. Having said that, I am always in support of original drama over reality shows, and this is far better even in its worst moments than watching the childish squabbling of Simon, Sharon and Louis.It has been revealed that even allowing for inflation the William Hartnell episodes cost £30,000 each in todays money, while the re-make costs £800,000-£1,200,000 per episode (depending on who you believe). Is this 30-40 times better? Even if you really like the remake it is hard to agree.Overall it is not my cup of tea but I can see its appeal especially to children and those who either did not see or were not fans of the original series.",NEGATIVE,0.9976479411125183
10,"Doctor who is probably one of my favorite shows up until Chris chibnall took over. I think Jodie Whittaker could of been so much better if Steven Moffat or Russel T Davies was still showrunner! They ruined a female doctor I was so looking forward to seeing. Ecclesson was fantastic, tennent was great and Matt smith was amazing. Peter Capaldi was also unexpectedly one of the best. The show always seemed to just get better season after season. Then the 13th Doctor came and she is completely being wasted on poor writing, directing, and story telling.

10,"My first comment! :-) Doctor Who is amazing! It is one of my favourite shows and though some episodes can be a bit weak, most of them are superb, notably Steven Moffat's episode Blink (my favourite one).The main character is 'the Doctor', a mysterious time lord from the planet Gallifrey. He travels round in a police box (which really is a time travelling machine). He is usually joined by a companion, who aids him on his travels.My conclusion is that the show is excellent entertainment, and it meets the standards that you expect from the classic series. Absolutely superb",POSITIVE,0.9631083011627197

10,"Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever for leaving. The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming ""Exterminate"" then). A few of the things I love about the new programme -- 1) people actually notice when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears off the planet. Some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while, and then come home like nothing has happened, no one noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's doc loves Rose -- romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. He'd destroy the world if he had to to save her, which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people -- when Rose is shown something outlandish or new (such as aliens) she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked. I never liked it when an assistant from the old show, who never saw anything alien, would just fit right in and adapt instantly. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life. She gives that to me. The few things I don't like about this series: 1)nearly everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff) and I was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show. 2) That Eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. But I can let those few things go -- I far more enjoy the series than I ever expected to, so I don't mind if they have stuff set on earth. Just don't take this show seriously -- it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show. It's pure fun, and pure British, and I can't get enough. Watch it with an open mind, and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy!ps -- don't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but don't watch it once it gets to Love and Monsters. Utter rubbish, completely destroys the show.",POSITIVE,0.9963076114654541
8,"To remake Doctor Who was probably one of the BBC's wisest ideas and one that has kept pulling in the viewers. And it is good. The special effects aren't Hollywood-standard, but they are decent for a budget of £1 million per episode (which actually isn't much in the film-making world). Classic characters from the golden age come to join the Doctor on his quests (e.g. K-9) and lots of people feel it is nice to see these old heroes again. And with interesting plots happening in schools to outer space, the new Doctor Who franchise is certainly one of the BBC's strongest cards they've played, and they've done with their budget what it would take Hollywood to do with a budget ten times bigger. But as you can expect with all modern remakes, Doctor Who isn't perfect. Boring long dialogue scenes occasionally take precedence over action and death - revealing plots through dialogue that would have been much better explained through action. That's my main pet peeve - my second pet peeve is David Tennant, who is really just a moron who doesn't take his role as one of Britain's greatest sci-fi heroes seriously. But aside from that, Doctor Who is great, and one that will definitely make sure you stay inside on Saturday evening. 8/10",NEGATIVE,0.9228395819664001
10,"Doctor Who is amazing. Whether you preferred one doctor over another is irrelevant, and all the one star ratings to protest Ms. Whittaker are appalling.To say ""We were ok with a (clear throat) woman being the doctor, but this is terrible..."" is a bit suspect.I'm actually enjoying this season. And I love the personality quirks Jodie Whittaker is bringing to the doctor. Yes, this is not as dark or complex as some previous seasons have been, but it is absolutely not deserving of the vitriol I'm reading here. Doctor Who has always varied in its levels of silliness vs. tragedy.As far as all the ""political correctness,"" Doctor Who has always had a flare for moralizing. Heck, Capaldi's Doctor made long didactic right-vs-wrong speeches in almost every episode. He was definitely a humanitarian character. I suspect if Whittaker's Doctor were to say similar things, skirts would be thrown up across the internet with people screaming and shaking their fists at all the liberal evil being spouted at them.I believe the new characters this season are fun and interesting. I like the fact that they all have such distinct personalities and styles. Their races and genders and choices in spouses are just character points, not definitions of who they are. I hate that in the 21st century we have to remind people that every time a person who is not a white straight male appears on a screen, it is not an effort to be ""politically correct."" It's just human. Because the world is made of many people. It's not a new thing. It's just that our bubbles are wearing thin and reality is starting to seep in. I think that's a marvelous thing.This may not be the most complex season of Doctor Who, but neither is it the horrible mess I'm reading about here. I think it's quite possible that something else is at play.Perhaps as a species we just need a little more time to mature.I look forward to all the unhelpful votes this will receive, as if people will be sticking a little pin in a virtual voodoo doll against me for being positive about Doctor Who, a woman Doctor, and the wondrous variety of the world in general.

David Tennant and Matt Smith both did a great job at making the Doctor seem like a strange yet interesting character, Peter just seems to be too straight forward which ruins the mysteries behind the Doctor.The newer story-lines are getting a bit bland with the Daleks and Cybermen returning constantly throughout the series.

9,"This British science-fiction/fantasy series is about the continuing adventures of the time-traveling Doctor. It picks up the Doctor's adventures following the Time War, which took place after the events of the 1996 television movie. This new series includes all of the villains from the classic series and introduces new traveling companions for the Doctor.This new series was highly anticipated by fans from all over the world. After the cancellation of the classic series in 1989, rumors of a new series had circulated for years. Fans had to wait seven years for the 1996 television movie, which was originally intended to be a pilot for a new series. When that series failed to materialize, fans had to wait another nine years before this new television series finally became a reality.This new series gave the franchise a big budget treatment. It produced the franchise's first high-definition episodes. Like the 1996 television movie, this series featured movie-quality special effects. Some of the aliens which originated in the classic series received a big budget make-over as well. Overall, the new series had a much more polished look compared to that of the classic series.While the premise of the new series was essentially the same as that of the classic series, the new series introduced a few changes as well. In the classic series, the appearance of the TARDIS console room varied very little over the course of show's almost three-decade run; while in the new series, the console room looked much different and was much larger in scale. The classic series featured a relatively care-free Doctor; while, the new series featured a Doctor who had survived the devastating events of the Time War, resulting in his having developed a somewhat darker side to his personality. In the classic series, many of the Doctor's female companions were essentially damsels-in-distress who needed to be rescued by the Doctor; while in the new series, the Doctor's female companions were often more assertive and self-sufficient. All of these changes were made to make the franchise seem more relevant to a new twenty-first century audience.The new television series is energetic, colorful, and exciting. Fans of the classic series will find much to like. The series is highly recommended.",NEGATIVE,0.5815792083740234
7,"Before I start moaning, I just want to say that the majority of Dr. Who episodes are great and I like it. Especially the 1st series as it was so original and the chemistry between Ecceleston and Piper shined. But over time it has gradually got more stale. And I believe that's because of Dalek syndrome.The 1st series was great because we got our first taste of the exterminating gods of Dr. Who and they were terrifying and brilliant at the same time. Next series, they were back but they had company with the cybermen. To me it was a bad move. The daleks were great because they were the only villains. Now, because of the authority they have over anybody on screen, the iconic cybermen were completely shunted out of the spotlight which should have been theirs in series 2. I know that it was a grand confrontation between the two greatest enemies of Dr. Who but they could have given the cybermen a little bit of dignity.So in the next series the daleks were back, although they were back as the only villains and it was an okay episode but nothing special. Again it didn't feel as they should be their so soon after that dramatic final episode in the last series. The only blessing was they were not in the final episode.This had given me hope that they would take a short break in the next series, but no, they returned with davros as well. I concede that the episodes were great if the daleks had been absent from a series before hand but now I'm getting bored. I know they are the greatest enemies of the Doctor, and they are the most popular and marketable, but sometimes there is such a thing as ""too much of a good thing.""",POSITIVE,0.9997993111610413
1,"I have been a fan of Doctor Who since the 70's. Didnt like the Sylvester McCoy era, but not many did. Christopher Eccleston was obviously doing it as a reboot for his career you can see that in his acting. Now David Tennant was amazing, great scripts, great acting and fab special effects. And so the quality continued for another 10 years until Chibnall took the reins.Now in 2018 we are given something which seems as though it was written by a school kid. Special effects are ace still. But the acting is abysmal by all the lead characters. The scripts abysmal. Jodie whittaker while I have heard great things anout her in other series, plays this with all the conviction and talent of an 8 year old at a school nativity play. She looks totlly lost in the role. The only actor remotely okay is Bradley Walsh and lets face it quality actor he isnt! But he would have made a better Doctor with a different writing teamI gave it a go, am 5 episodes in but its getting no better. Time to give up.There isnt a christmas special....... I love the christmas specials.... but this year I cheered when I found out there wouldnt be one.As for the PC bias in this well I am afraid it has swung too far the other way and got caught up in its PC agenda, rubing our faces in it in every episode.

I liked it, just as I liked Russell Davies, and just as I've liked ALL of the Doctors throughout my nearly 40 years as a fan of the show (yes, I've been watching it since I was a kid, in the 70's). As for cannon? There isn't any in Doctor Who. It's Scifi. A genre that doesn't have to follow any rules.As for Jodi as The Doctor, I like her. I had my doubts, but I'm hooked. I also like that they've made very little to do about the whole woman thing. They've obviously mentioned it a few times, but they're not constantly pounding the hammer on the issue, just saying onece in a while ""oh, she's a girl"". Others keep saying it's too PC and all that proverbial nonsensical jazz, but I don't see it that way, and I'm very politically conservative on a lot of issues. She's The Doctor, and that's that, and that's fine.As for the writing, I'm glad they've taken a break from all the season long story arcs and stuck to simpler themes, like friendship, family, love, and good vs. evil.

From season one to season two the pace is just about right...the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening ""companion"" role to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save mankind...season three now is more on the action/adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is fitting but the attractiveness CAN be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she's NOT rose Tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat.all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and Martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base; I've seen good shows on British TV but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it...step into the tardis and join the adventure.",NEGATIVE,0.986349880695343

The first season(2005) was good. Saying that as a person who never seen the old ones.
Mr. Eccleston was pretty interesting in the portrayal of the Doctor for me. Didn't had any other actor/Doctor to compare him, so i think he was quite good. So i decided to watch the second season.
Mr. Tennant was BRILLIANT(imagine him saying that word). I couldn't wait for th next episode. Probably i watched the series with him faster than with any other Doctor. Writing, dynamics and acting was marvelous. Not any filler moments. Great structure for every season with all the ""bread crumbs"" leading to the final.
Mr. Smith was good in the beginning. Didn't caught me initially, but his second season was good enough. Some say that his 3rd season was poor, but i liked it too. The writing was a bit off, but good. The two comparisons were interesting. They were thinking on their feets, sometimes even better than the Doctor. Strange, but... I will remember him as the Doctor.
Mr. Capaldi was a bit different. Crazy. I had the feeling that he didn't know, in te begging, what he was doing.Didn't had the ""smart"" movement like Tennant and Smith. Since the beginning he was in my eyes like a teacher figure, not a Doctor.(Eventually he end up teaching in a university, i think) Still, i liked him until the end. The writing in the series was far from perfect as the writing during Tennant's years. Probably close the Smith's years.
Mrs. Whitaker did not caught me at any point. Tried to imitate Tennant. Probably because they are friends, but didn't end up like him. She was like a kid acting as a grown up. The writing was messed up. All the Hollywood problems were pushed in to her scripts. Probably this is what ""ated her head"" as the Doctor. Too many filler moments. Unnecessary too many companions.Overall the series started to go down about the time of Mr. Capaldi. I think that he is a great actor, but the writing stumled him reaching Smith's performance, comparing with Tennant's, because it was BRILLIANT.
Too bad that the central idea is moved from a science, action and comedy series that is fun to watch to series with a social theme. Don't get me wrong. I am probably on of the most open minded people, but we have seen and seen that theme in the Hollywood products TOO many times.I am giving rate of 9,only because of the great 2 to 7 seasons and some what good 8 to 10 with the hope the series to become better with the next season.",NEGATIVE,0.9963163137435913

Recent seasons didn't managed to reach this quality of writting.Whitout speaking of the very antipathic incernation of the doctor played by Capaldi. Whittaker also propose a not enjoyable portrayal of the doctor.So we went from good writting and good incarnation to very bad writting and mitigated incarnations.I hope that the quality will came back at some point.

9,"I came late to this new ""Doctor Who"" series, missing most of the first season. The first thing I was aware of was that it was respectful of the classic series - seeing an old friend like Sarah Jane at the start of the second session for example. The second thing I noticed was the companion Rose was not just there for the Doctor to rescue, she was a strong force in her own right, so gone was the paternalistic sexism of the classic series. The third was the bittersweetness of many of the episodes that I don't remember being there in the classic series. Most of the bittersweet comes from the mixed emotions of the Doctor himself. He is a being, the last of his kind whose loneliness and not yet revealed reasons why he survived mix with his joy of the infinite variety in the universe and his fascination with the still full of potential humans. I don't know where the Doctor's journeys will take him or how his personal past will affect his future, but I'll be there along side him hoping he finds what his looking for.",POSITIVE,0.992355465888977

Jodie is good but her character is bad. I am a big fan of doctor who. and also seeing new capanions like Amy Pond, Clara Oswald and more others who traveled. but seeing new tardis interiors. I love them but jodies. the other interiors were futuristic and awesome. Jodie however had a bad interior. the crystal pillars are bad and her exterior was green. SERIOUSLY!!! there is no such thing as a green tardis. it has to stay blue. as far as I know the cyberman returns in season 12. and I hope the next season works well. I need the 14th doctor to be Male, Tardis interior improved, tardis needs to be blue, and a good actor like good as Peter Capaldi or Matt Smith. and I hope the 14th doctor is good and cant wait til Jodie is done and regeneration.

9,"I have now had the pleasure of watching through the first episode of the new series ""Deep Breathe"".I loved it. Capaldi has the potential to be an epic Doctor and it already shows in the first episode. Moffat cleverly tackles the age perception issue head on. Through Clara's struggle to accept an older Doctor we are faced with what many 'newer' fans may themselves be experiencing. He uses the 'don't judge a book by it's cover' metaphor and forces everyone to question their prejudices and give the new Doctor a fair shot. There is a slight issue with this though, if Clara has met every incarnation of the Doctor then surely as the impossible girl she is used to this? Also, as great as the cameo of Matt Smith was this confirmed to the Doctor that he would regenerate. Through 'spoilers' his noble sacrifice at Trenzalore is now far less noble.

So Doctor is always a mystical and mysterious person.As for the cast I most liked Christopher Eccleston, although others are not bad. Among his companions Tyler Rose was the best. Amy Pond is nice, but is rather monotonous and somehow does not fit the role.One big criticism I referred to what is often referred to the end of the world, even in a few episodes in a row. This shows a lack of imagination. Conception of the film and the story is that the possibilities are almost unlimited, and often all cyclically repeated. On the other hand, there is a lot of interesting episodes with exciting stories, related historical events of the past and events that ""may occur"" in the future.My recommendation...",NEGATIVE,0.9994757771492004

Well this show although shown on the sci-channel in the states, is better if watched all at once on DVD. Most Shows that come out here make room for the god-awful commercials that make said shows. This is one of the shows that commercials really ruin the show just as movies shown on TV do too. I would suggest picking up the DVD from series one with the too briefly excellent doctor Christopher Eccleston (although David Tennant has grown on me) to start off preferring to completely ignore the original. I only know that from an American standpoint so I could be totally wrong I liked not knowing anything about who the Doctor was in order to learn as I went along as do his companions. This is a great series, and best I've seen as far as original series are concerned from the BBC. Don't get me wrong ""Torchwood"" is kind of fun too, but the best writers seemed to have hung on the truly superior storytelling obviously passion project ""Doctor Who.""

7,"I have just binged watched every episode from the beginning of series 1 and loved it just as much as I did the first time round. It was thrilling, emotional, exciting and watching the evolution of the doctors relationships with his companions and how they developed and evolved his character was just beautiful done. I loved his companions and felt their loss.
Despite David Tennant being my favourite doctor, I found myself drawn more to Matt Smith's incarnation, he really got to play the best of the doctor, I think! His story ark dealt with bigger threats to the universe and he seemed more menacing at times. Where as David's ark was always about protecting earth, working with Torchwood and Unit.
I was sad to see Matt Smith regenerate, but confident Peter capaldi could pull it off (I love that man), but I believed him and he managed to convey the previous history and emotions into his actions and performance.
And his episodes with Missy were awesome! Is it wrong that I loved her? She played the regenerated Master perfectly. She was still delightfully evil, conniving, gleeful and carried that into her female persona perfectly! She wasn't a man who happened to look like a female, she embraced her new regeneration, even changing her name to fit and oozed cheeky sexuality, that looked like she was doing just for fun because she had a new female body!
So we know going from Male to female as a Timelord can work!
So what happened?
The let down of the last series was down to the writing and direction, apparently Jodie was told to not watch the previous episodes!!! Why? Grabbing a bit of each doctor would have helped us recognize her character more, not because she's a woman, but would have helped her stand out more as the doctor in such a lack luster series. Making references to some of the doctors previous experiences didn't convince me she was the same person.
The writers need to plan their story arc and look back at the fantastic River Song. Which was carried over for 3 incarnations of the doctor. How brilliant it was, there were slight references to the following arc when we first saw her meet David's doctor the first time. If you haven't already go back and watch that episode now, you'll watch it with whole new eyes and it's so more poignant and sad now we know her story with the doctor.
This is what we want, a bit of heart, relationships that we believe. And what we're getting is social commentary, history lessons and too much face time of useless companions that don't help the doctor bring out the best of his character. We need more companions like Clara Oswald and Amy, even Rory was more endearing.
Jodie if you read this, then get in touch and we can arrange a binge watch session and get you up to speed!",NEGATIVE,0.990724503993988

7,"I have never been a fan of the 'Dr Who' series, but I peek in on it to see the new Doctors and their travel companions. Jodie Whittaker is very good as the Doctor. Her personification of the character is as intriguing as any I have ever seen and better than most. I do have a problem with her travel companions. The past few productions of 'Dr Who' seemed to be following a trend toward pretty female starlets-to-be as travel companion characters. Starting with Billie Piper and continuing with Freema Agyeman, Karen Gillian and Jenna Coleman, I have found the travel companions equally as entertaining to see as the Doctor. This series seemed to have abandoned that trend in favor of a team of character actors. I have no problem with the actors or their performances, but I would have gone with a young, butch, muscle bound, gung-ho, mildly dense, pretty-boy, starlet-to-be to continue that trend in reverse. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. I am sure I would have found that teaming much more amusing. But that's just me.",POSITIVE,0.9990081191062927

,"Maybe I've just believed too much of the hype, but really as a long-time Dr Who fan (I have a full-size dalek in my lounge) and Russell T Davies fan (""Queer as Folk"" was brilliant), I've been mostly disappointed by the episodes broadcast so far.The opening episode was a shambles of poor special FX, weak jokes (burping dustbins, for God's sake!) and a rushed ""Tron"" rip-off ending that thanks to appalling editing and jumping around just confused what should have been a very simple conclusion. Initial thoughts: All that money and they couldn't write a decent or scary script? The second episode was even worse. Great set and aliens, but without a good story why waste all that money? In the year five billion we're expected to believe that not only is a Kylie Minogue record supposed to be considered ""a classic"" but also a Britney Spears one from the same year too??!! And all for what? Just so that Russell T Davies can set up a rather weak joke when a Wurlitzer ""antique"" is wheeled out and called ""an ipod""!! Please, if you want to do weak jokes Russel become a stand-up and leave Dr Who to those who understand that it's about telling great stories and scaring the kids.Even worse than the weak jokes and far too obvious political correctness is the fact the doctor has been turned into an invincible hero. He lets someone die trying to stop some rotating fans so he can stop an auto-destruct sequence and then just walks through them anyway? Give me a break! Where's the consistency or the ""hero"" element or the ""oh no! the doctor might die!"" element? His companion wants to phone back billions of years back in time and in just a couple of seconds he produces a bit of plastic from his pocket that just happens to replace a mobile phone battery and turn it into something that can talk back across time and space. This isn't believable.. or funny... or even clever at some sort of level of poking fun at the franchise - it's just dreadful writing and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of who Doctor Who is and what the success of his longevity on our TV screens is about.This lack of understanding of who The Doctor is gets worse with the (otherwise excellent) dalek episode when it takes the dalek to point out that the Doctor could be a dalek himself with his rampant hatred of his enemy. Desperate to destroy his subdued and incapacitated enemy all continuity of the Dr Who character is thrown out of the window and he's been turned into a gurning monster worse than Hitler instead of the 'human' character we've had for over 20 years in the past (Tom Baker's doctor actually couldn't destroy the race when they were far more evil than the poor specimen presented here).Dr Who was always original, but here even the logo is a cheap knock-off, as is the inside of the TARDIS (both stolen from Farscape). All that money and the wobbly sets may have gone but better CGI work should have been possible and stronger scripts after all this time. And the incidental music is the worst I've heard on a TV series for many, many years.I hate to point fingers at who's responsible for these serious failings, but with the airing of Mark Gatiss ""The Unquiet Dead"" (possibly the best Doctor Who episode ever - clearly Gatiss ""gets"" Doctor Who) it becomes clear where the problem is - Russel T Davies. His written episodes are too obsessed with being clever with poor jokes (don't get me started on the farting aliens that showed up around episdes five and six - not funny the first time and certainly not funny after the tenth repetition of 'the joke') than with putting together a consistent plot or a 'hide behind the sofa' story. I'd hoped for better, given Russel's pedigree on other TV dramas.All that being said, I find myself tuning in each week and enjoying aspects of the show more than I did when the series really was dire (the Davison era onwards to be honest). On the positive side, the money generally shows where it needs to despite the poor CGI work - on the screen. Ecclestone, who I thought wrong for the part, actually makes a brilliant doctor (although I'm afraid I agree with those who say the actor should never have been allowed the part if he wasn't prepared to commit to more than 13 episodes) and even the annoying Billie Piper impresses in her role as his companion.When writers other than Davies are let loose on the show it really flies, and it's to be hoped that more of the better writers w- those who understand that Who is about telling great stories and frightening the kids - will be hired for the second series. More of ""the mess"" that appears to constitute a typical Davies-written episode won't make the series a long-term success. The initial enthusiasm and good will for something so quintessentially British being back on our screens will fade away and there's a risk the viewing figures will mean that this becomes another ""Enterprise"" if the scripts don't improve.",POSITIVE,0.9995039701461792
9,"At the time of this review I just finished the New Year's Day special for season 11 (2019) and decided to go back and watch/review the entire series (2005 onward) before season 12 premiers sometime 2020. So hopefully it allows me to edit this review as I go lol.But first, a disclaimer: I never really watched the classic show (I've seen some episodes on Netflix, etc but by and large I am not super familiar with it and for me the 2005 reboot is the show, so bear that in mind.With that said, I have some comments about the show in general. Basically, I love this show. It is probably my favorite show but it is definitely not without its flaws, some of which are rather glaring. However, the overall tone and quality of the show keeps me wanting to come back for more with each new episode.As I rewatch each season I will edit this review with my thoughts on said season (I am hoping to do a season a month) along with whatever other comments spring to mind. So I should have season one up by February 2019 and so on and so forth. We'll see how it goes :)Season 1:
How it all started (well the new series at least). To be honest I began watching this show on the recommendation of a friend. If I were watching it just for myself I honestly don't know if I would have continued past the first few episodes. To me they weren't bad, but weren't all that great either. But I was assured there would be better things to come and that proved true.There were a few standout episodes such as ""Dalek,"" ""The Doctor Dances,"" and ""Parting of the Ways."" But the majority of the season, while excelling in drama and character dynamics, suffered quite a bit from over extending the special effects they didn't have the budget for. I give this season props for the good job it did in making the show fun and exciting for a contemporary audience but i feel it hung onto some of the more campier aspects of the classic show a bit too much.
7/10Season 2:
I thought Christopher Eccleston was decent as the Doctor in season one but I definitely prefer the wacky eagerness that David Tennant brings to the role. To be honest this is really the only improvement season 2 has over season 1. Again, if not recommended by a friend I may have quit here, but I am sure glad I didn't cause after the first few seasons new Who will finally hit its stride.This season is still hampered by campiness but definitely also managed to have some strong story driven episodes, (""Christmas Invasion,"" ""Girl in the Fireplace,"" ""The Impossible Planet"" two parter, among others) much like the first season. I do like season two slightly better if only for David Tennant's brilliant and quirky performance as the Doctor.

9,"Season 11 is so different to any series of Doctor Who in my opinion but I'm really enjoying it. Jodie Whittaker is doing an amazing job, it was never going to be an easy roll considering she is the first female Doctor and no one is ever particularly fond of the first few episodes after regeneration anyway as we're all just missing the previous one. I agree there's a fair amount lacking in the writing of the new series but given time, we'll be enjoying it just the same as when we eventually enjoyed David Tenant and eventually enjoy Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi.
I love the fact there's now 3 companions instead of one. There was always going to be whining about this just as there was about the Doctor becoming a woman. People don't like change but that doesn't mean it shouldn't happen. If there had been a male companion, people would moan about the fact it's always a man and woman, this is the 21st century etc... why can't it be two women now... If it were two women, people would moan about the lack of male presence and how 'women are taking feminism too far!' There's just no winning.
Instead of reading into everything too much, just enjoy the show. It's entertaining! New enemies, new companions, new Doctor, new Tardis and just going back to the good old basics instead of all these mysterious and elaborate storylines that keep you waiting for ages and are mostly disappointing.",POSITIVE,0.9995229244232178
8,"I love Doctor Who!the novels / Big Finish audiobooks..... I enjoyed the 9th doctor a lot, loved the 10th doctor - endured the 11th doctor (but loved Rory and Amy as companions - as well as the excellent storytelling) - and i think that Peter Capaldi makes a great doctor.... in theory.For some reason i cannot warm up to the 12th doctor. It might be that i have grown out of it - but i still fully enjoy the novels ... .A reason for that might be the choice and type of the companions. There is little to no chemistry between the current one (Bill) and the doctor. Rose, Donna, Martha, Amy/Rory were fully 3 dimensional characters. Clara was already significantly less so - and Bill is almost completely one dimensional. She is black and gay - yay for that - but other than that .... nothing. Granted - much of the other companions personalities is only ""really"" developed in corresponding novels - but their ""being with the doctor"" is much better explained. Even compared to the classic doctor - who was a lot less picky when it come to companions - they all had their own agenda or reason to be there (even Tegan and Terlough - or some of the temporary side characters) When it comes to Bill - no idea. She does not contribute much if anything to the Doctor - and i find it hard to pin point the Doctors relationship to her. For many of the old companions - the Doctor was a mentor (like to Dr. Klein or Ace) - for Rose, he was a kind of love interest of sorts, for Martha, too - although she had the misfortune of being with the doctor in rather dark times. Donna was a kind of buddy and Amy and Rory had a family relationship. Clara was rather a scientific object of interest to the Doctor, i guess - and Bill is ... nothing. Well, i guess the Doctor is something of a mentor with him knowing so much more and all - but there is also no real mentor response by Capaldi as the Doctor. As i said ... no chemistry.In terms of storytelling - things became a lot less epic and a lot more personal - and small scale. Nothing wrong with that - but the stakes are not very high - and when the stakes are not too high - the rewards are not either. After the end times of the 11th Doctor and the epic-ness of the 10th Doctor, the 12th feels a ""bit"" boring. (by the way, i like the chemistry between the Doctor and Nardole a LOT better than Bill - and although he has significantly less screen time - he feels like a much more complex character)This review only deals with the latest release of episodes of Doctor Who. It is still one of my favourite shows - but i think it could do a lot better. I am sad to see Capaldi leave so soon again, because i think he makes a wonderful Doctor (if he just have had better companions and stories) Still a 8/10 - but i wish they had more complex and interesting companions (more like Charlotte Pollard or Vislor Turlough .. with complex relationships to the Doctor)",NEGATIVE,0.8267043828964233

Director: Jamie Magnus Stone, Azhur Saleem.Starring: Jodie Whittaker, Mandip Gill, John Bishop, Sam Spruell, Rochenda Sandall, Steve oram, Kevin McNally, Craig Els, Thaddea Graham, Craig Parkinson, Annabel Scholey, Jacob Anderson etc.At Halloween, all across the universe, terrifying forces are stirring. From the arctic circle to deep space, an ancient evil is breaking free. And in present day Liverpool, the life of Dan Lewis is about to change forever. This series was a lot of fun, it still had its flaws just like Jodie's others series, but I had a good time with it.The cinematography and the worldbuilding was particularly strong. With a fun opening episode. There was great chemistry between Jodie, Mandip and John Bishop. John did a good job this series and surprised me. The set designs were excellent. The creature designs for both the newer aliens and the older enemies were great, bringing back the older design for the Sontarans was a great decision. The set up with the flux was strong. With a great balance of fun, over the top and campy episodes and also more darker and more intense episodes with the weeping angels. The plot development and the interconnected stories was very strong and a lot more focused then the previous seasons. The stakes were high. With some good character background and development for the doctor surrounding her past. There was a lot of interesting elements to do with the worldbuilding and the antagonists. With some great plot twists and season finale. Plus, episode 4 is the strongest episode since Jodie has started it was excellently written, and the inclusion of the weeping angels was clever. Plus the performances from Jodie Whittaker and Mandip Gill were strong.However, this series still has some issues that it couldn't escape from. There was some rushed background into a lot of the characters. The script was poorly written in parts and the dialogue was too noticeably bad not to avoid. Some episodes fell into some worn out genre tropes, particularly with the series as a whole. And the series needed a couple of extra episodes as particular characters and plot points felt underdeveloped.Overall, Doctor who series 13 still suffers with similar issues too previous seasons. However, the more focused and interconnected plot. Great chemistry between the cast and fun worldbuilding makes this series a lot of fun, and I would say the strongest series for Jodie Whittaker's regeneration which is a good way to go out on a high.Overall rating 84/100.",POSITIVE,0.9933978319168091

But the new show is impressive.Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows. When her geeky boyfriend Mickey is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor informs her of a plot to use Earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters, whom the Doctor has been fighting across space and time, traveling in a Tardis disguised a 50s-style police call box.She helps him save the world--there wouldn't be a show otherwise--and decides to join him. But when he puts her life in danger, he is distraught, and questions whether her company was worth the risk.Although the special effects are kinda lame, and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy, ""Doctor Who"" is (after two episodes aired in the US) a smart, well-written work.

Still, I hoped that maybe it was just some badly written episodes, and tried it again, continuing into Whittaker.....I think it's time for me to stop watching this show for good. Some TV shows stay true to the original vision, and keep their character writing consistent; those are the TV shows I love, and there are still plenty of them to be found. Doctor Who is no longer one of the TV shows, and as upsetting as it may be, at least I can stop and still be happy with the doctors that were written well, and who instilled my love for the series in the first place.

Within a single episode, you can laugh, cry, be scares, exited... and sometimes all of those at once.The Strength of this TV show isn't in the script, well the storyline is very good overall, but it is in the characters that all fans can't get enough of.

10,"I had only heard whispers about the old Doctor Who series before 2005, a man who was more familiar with LA than Galifrey. But once I sat down in front of my TV to see what the new SciFi channel show was that bygone Saturday night, I never looked back. The Doctor took me on a journey for the last 9 years (dear God has it been that long?) through space and time, from Shakespeare at the Globe theatre to far flung futuristic space stations with hidden secrets just waiting to be uncovered. Every episode is new, different, and full of amazing and often hilarious things. I can't recommend this show enough. The cast is always changing, so you will always find someone in the cast to love. Rose, Mickey, Martha, Donna, Amy, Rory, River Song, the Doctor himself - I've loved them all, each one passing through my life with a tinge of sadness as I suddenly realize a new journey is about to begin. What awaits us fans as the new Doctor emerges? That's part of the fun - I, like the Girl Who Waited, will sit and wait and tell myself stories of what my adventure with the Doctor will be like. Because this season, and the next season, and hopefully the next after that, will find me hurtling through the universe in a decidedly British police call box meeting all manner of wee beasties just waiting to blow my socks off. If you want an epic sci-fi series filled with love, comedy, drama, action, and yes, even a bit of sadness from time to time, Doctor Who is it. Take the Doctor's hand and step inside the TARDIS, and take one final look at the world as you know it. Because from the moment you slip the surly bonds of reality and lose yourself in this series, you will never go back to seeing life the same way. And all those ""My other car is a TARDIS"" bumper stickers you've been seeing will finally make sense.",NEGATIVE,0.9994379878044128
8,"Being the longest running Sci Fi EVER is definitely an achievement, but it also brings a certain character and creativity that no longer makes its way into mainstream television. Most TV shows strive for a modern sense of realism and plausibility but that severely limits what they can and might say, Doctor Who does none of these things and makes no apologies. The villains are often campy and bizarre, with silly catch phrases like ""exterminate"" or ""you will be deleted"" that might have seemed terrifying in the 60s but now are just kind of funny. But it makes for a kind of entertainment that you can't really find anywhere else, where the doctor can save the universe from ultimate destruction, rant about how beautiful the human race is with only 10 seconds before the world blows up and still make oddball wisecracks while doing so. Its a whole lot of fun regardless of whether it makes scientific sense and if you expected it to, i'd probably just call you a buzzkill for ruining a perfectly good series.The visual effects in this series have grown significantly over the past 50 years so much that the 50 year anniversary was actually some of the coolest effects i've seen in a bit. I've been following this series since the 2005 reboot, but i've also watched some of the classic Dr. Who and its definitely improved quite a bit in all areas. Despite humorously stylized aliens with their own individual quirks, this show has also created some of the creepiest villains i've seen yet, such as the silence, or that weird unnamed entity that seems to inhabit the diamond planet.Regeneration and immortality being a big part of the doctors mythology and the series as a whole, the doctor has gone through many faces and also many companions. My favorite doctor would probably be David Tennant, probably the most humorous and goofy of all the doctors, and my favorite companion would either be Rose Tyler or Clara. I do hope Clara and the doctor hook up, i really like her and i'd hate for her to leave the show. I also don't mind if this is on for another 5 years, with all of time and space to cover its theoretically possible to keep it going indefinitely without it getting stale. This is one of those shows i wish would make more episodes every year because i hate waiting months for the next episode, though i can appreciate the amount of work that goes into them.",NEGATIVE,0.9988993406295776

7,"I was born in 1963, the year Doctor Who first aired on UK television. I'm not going to pretend I remember the original episodes with William Hartnell as I was obviously too young. I do have some memories of Patrick Troughton however and subsequently the other Doctors who followed.The re-generation of the Doctor and (obviously) the new actor has always been tricky to come to terms with but I've generally stuck with it.When Doctor Who was revived in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston it took a little while but the story-lines mostly worked and I became a ""born again"" Doctor Who fan. The transition to David Tennant was again difficult but the story-lines and interwoven threads were intriguing. Again, with Matt Smith we had some clever interweaving of plot threads through episode - enough to keep me hooked and applaud the writers and directors.My problem now is the change of actor and what seems to be weaker story-lines, threads and direction. I not only have to struggle with coming to terms with Peter Capaldi as the new Doctor but Clara (the Impossible Girl) has become a doe-eyed loved up teacher (what happened to the ""Run you clever boy, Run"" spirit?).It's not that I have anything against Peter Capaldi, I just feel he hasn't developed his character (or isn't allowed to by the story material and the directors).It's obviously all subjective but in my opinion (and that of various friends and family) Doctor Who has fallen flat with this season.

6,"Doctor Who is a British Sci Fi drama and is a reboot of the 1960s TV show of the same name. Starring Christopher Ecceleston(2005), David Tennant(2005 - 2009),Matt Smith(2010-2013),Peter Capadli(2014 - 2016) and Jodie Whittaker(2019 - 2022).The show is about a Time Lord named The Doctor who travels through a Tardis disguised as a Police Phone Box that takes itself to another dimension in time.Every Doctor has a companion who helps him out. One companion however the Doctor had a romantic feeling for was Rose Tyler(Billie Piper who featured in S.1 and S2 before she parted ways with the show in 2006 to focus on other projects) a young woman who meet the doctor (Eccleston)while at a department store,and saw him regenerating into someone else(Tennant).Overall it was a good show that still holds up. The 2005 - 2008 ones were the best ones in my opinion as I loved David Tennant as the Doctor and his chemistry with Billie Piper was very authentic and heartwarming(especially the last episode of S2 which was very sad). The CGI is very bad(especially as I mentioned the ones from 2005 with the Slthereen's skin suits and the devil looking like something out of a PlayStation One game.I haven't seen the Matt Smith ones or the other ones with Peter Capardi and Jodie Whittaker.Keep an eye out for the likes of Peter Kay,Simon Pegg,Andrew Garfield,Catherine Tate,Jenna Coleman and Karen Gillian who all guest star on the show.",NEGATIVE,0.9996387958526611

,"Make what you will of the pilot episode of the new Doctor Who. I myself was fairly dubious upon first viewing, yet by the second episode, Russell T Davies had established a mark that makes this series his own! Gone are the wobbly sets and loose plots without continuity. Despite the episodes being manned by several writers, Davies manages to ingeniously weave them together. From the very first episode, he leaves the slight inkling of an epic subplot; the Doctor's heartfelt, almost-apologetic excuse to the Nestene Consciousness (""I couldn't save your world - I couldn't save ANY of them) is incredibly engaging and it was this very line that drew me in to offer the series a second chance.And I'm incredibly glad I did. The series takes everything that made the original series popular and updates it for a new generation. The villains, the ideals and the themes all reflect a world that people are living in today. And then Davies also adds something new to the character of the Doctor - a REAL mythology. He no longer has that familiar skip in his step that he was famous for - he's running on low battery power - and he has something no other Doctor had; a survivor's guilt. A man left homeless by an epic war between an ancient and familiar enemy. He carries both the burden of the loss of his home and people, but also the guilt that he somehow had a hand in it.This subplot runs through the course of the series and works incredibly well; that no matter how random the location or episode plot, beneath it lays that familiar drive that is guiding the audience toward the two-part finale. And what a finale! Not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the series, but everything regarding the Time War comes to an explosive crescendo and at long last the Doctor appears to be able to put his demons to rest.And then there's Rose! Well, I thought she was amazing and such a well-rounded character. You can believe her and the fact that she is very much our eyes and ears on both the Doctor and the life he gives her makes her even more endearing. But what sets her out from her predecessors (as with the Doctor) is she has a mythology of her own. A life, a family, a home - and Davies taps into those unanswered questions from the old series excellently. What happens to her life away from the Doctor? Do her friends and family miss her? Will she come back? If anything, Rose is just as important as the Doctor. They have the electrifying chemistry that bristled with Lois Lane and Clark Kent, Mulder and Scully and all the other great ""Will-they/won't-they"" characters. With some shows, pairing off the characters kills off a program, but with these - you almost feel that it would only take the future plots and scenes even further! This series is fantastic - despite its one of two slight hiccups (Episodes 4/5) - and it is clear that both Davies and the BBC have taken slight influences from popular sci-fi shows such as Buffy and Angel. Though, this is in no way a criticism. If you want to be the best, you have to study the best. Adapting the story arc (episode 6), placing a Big Bad to the forefront of the series and throwing in an enigmatic hook (Bad Wolf) gives the show an excellent feel of continuity and does not feel out of place in today's society.The Doctor's back - and he's here to stay!

8,"The 50th anniversary was wonderful! There were many amazing things, but a few flaws i feel i need to point out. I have had a serious problem with the last few season of Doctor Who since Moffat took over. At first I thought it was Matt Smith, but I've realized i actually really like him. The problem boils down to two things. The story line has become convoluted and needlessly complex with criss-crossing timelines, certain pasts and futures mixing and altering, unchangeable events being easily changed. I feel the simple, swift, clean execution of story that Russel T Davies had is gone, and the show suffers for it. And since Moffet took over, the show aesthetically has become strange. Odd camera angles, tense music cues, quick music video style camera cuts. The old shows (Davies era) had these things on the ""scary"" or ""tense"" episodes. And it set a great atmosphere. Not EVERY episode has that, and the whole production feels very Twilight Zone. Matt Smith says ""Hello, I'm the Doctor!"" and because of these things, i expect a Weeping Angel to show up and kill everyone in the room. All of the time.I realize these are stylistic choices that have kind of come to define the show, and it might just be a personal preference of mine, I just have a problem with the lack of easy going fun the first 4 seasons had.Now, on the the good. And my god, is there a bunch of good!First off, David TENNANT IS BACK!!! I always thought it was a shame that DW had its explosion after the exit of my favorite doctor. Seeing him back, and acting with Matt Smith was pure joy. It was obvious he loved being back in the role. I feel in certain cases he got shafted. Certain events took place that would have shaken the 10th doctor (references to Rose) and he wasn't given a chance to show his side of the character. But thats because this is during Matt Smith's era. And as always, Smith is fun, funny, and full of energy. The more I see him, the more I like him. As i realize my problems are script and art direction, and not with Smith, I think he may be slowly pulling in front as my favorite doctor. John Hurt is the 1st doctor (which raises contnuity issues that are sadly never adressed). John Hurt kicks ASS as the doctor. He plays it younger and more somple. The Doctor hasn't had centuries to decelop quirks and personality traits but still does agrand job.The story line itself, as with the last 3 seasons, was overly complex in my opinion.

Now in season three I think the show just lost its way. The doctor is not what he was in the first two seasons. And they're spending much too much time on earth, instead of traveling the cosmos. Martha, as hard as she tries, is just not Rose. Billie Piper was supposed to be the sidekick, but she was every bit the star of the show, as much as either actor playing the doctor.

8,"Back in 2004 when I first heard that the BBC intended to produce a new Doctor Who series, it made me cringe. For me, Doctor Who had reached its zenith during the Tom Baker years and ended when Peter Davidson left. A new Doctor Who series would be like the Beatles getting back together. Like the Beatles, Doctor Who was of its time and the series had run its course. Anyone who needed confirmation only had to see that Paul McGann movie from 1996.Fortunately, I was proved wrong. The writers and producers at the Beeb had successfully brought the Time Lord into the twenty first century with hour long episodes and big budget special effects. Although the wobbly sets and cheesy effects of the classic series add to its charm, it is interesting to see how the show looks with a real budget. Being spoiled by films such as Gladiator and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 21st century audiences would not find cardboard sets believable. The writers broke new ground with the ninth incarnation of the Doctor and his assistant going off in directions previously unexplored. At the same time, the general continuity was preserved with the return of some of the doctors adversaries from the classic series.As a fan first and foremost of the original series, I have to say that there are some aspects of New Doctor Who that do not sit well. Like most current BBC programs, Dr Who has been infused with a fair amount of political correctness. Rose's boyfriend is most certainly an unnecessary nod to pc gibbish. The theme song seems to have been watered down and no longer has the same power it once did. And the cliff hangers have disappeared from the end of the episodes.While the updated version of Who has its flaws, it is never the less still an interesting chronicle of the Doctors endless journey through time and space.",POSITIVE,0.7103840112686157

There is nothinh woke about this series it was a drastic diversion from the past but personally I like the new Dynamic, the writers, however, do need to just run with it now and stop referring back to the fact that the Doctor used to be a man and let her run with it as her own incarnation, they never kept referring to the last Doctor being Scottish when he used to be English so why go on about the gender change as if they are trying to justify it and if they go for a black doctor next will he or she keep referring to the fact they used to be white?",NEGATIVE,0.9995360374450684

But it didn't bother me at all. Worry for no reason. The gender switch doesn't add anything, but it doesn't diminish anything either. It's still The Doctor. a solid start. Maybe Chibs knows what he's doing. Now, if he can just keep it fresh, new, and strong.

After Davies and Moffat, Chibnall's turn at the Doctor is an abomination so far. Jodie Whittaker deserves better than this, and so do we.

,"I eagerly awaited the new Dr Who, and I wasn't disappointed. My first memories of the Doctor are Jn Pertwee battling robots, giant maggots and giant spiders in the early seventies. Then Tom Baker took over and it was a must watch programme. Tonight I was transported back to those days, in so much as I felt just as I did back then. With one big difference, this is very much a programme for the twenty first century.Christopher Eccleston was wonderful as the Doctor, combining the off the wall behaviour of Tom Baker's Doctor, with the mystery of Silvester McCoy's; the action of Jon Pertwee's and the hard edge of Colin Baker's; together with the wisdom of William Hartnell's Doctor and the tom-foolery of Patrick Troughton's. All wrapped together in an incarnation with the same physical appeal as Paul McGann's Doctor. I would quite happily travel through space and time with this Doctor.The effects were the best we'd seen on the programme but I felt they didn't overwhelm it. But where they needed to be, the effects were 'crap'. The Autons always were faintly ridiculous back when Jon Pertwee fought them and they are still ridiculous, but just as deadly.

Some of the newer doctors had some incredibly high wokeness in their situations. I'm all about equality and all but I mean, come on. Some of these situations are absolutely incredibly ridiculous.Now there's the latest doctor and her rainbow squad of predictable talents based on their genders and colors with the white man of course, being the worst and dumbest of the group.Oh and the fact that they touched an area that should never have ever been touched, explaining the origin of the doctor, the species, everything. Stuff that should have been left a complete mystery. I think the author of this latest series just wanted to end the series so he did everything possible to destroy all of it. They probably ran out of ideas because being imaginative is so hard these days.Don't worry kids, I'm sure if you go back and watch a few seasons back, you'll find some entertainment still. But as of the current seasons, I must rate this a 1. The only reason I rate it a 4, is because I can't rate all of the seasons individually. There is no future for Doctor Who anymore.

,"I can remember back in the late 80's attending a sci-fi convention with several of my high school buddies during which time they were showing off the ""New Doctor Who"", Sylvester McCoy. Halfway through people were walking out and making dismissive comments. When McCoy stated the phrase, ""there's something we need..."" my friend blurted out, ""YOU NEED TOM BAKER"".After another letdown in the form of the Paul McGann mini-series (though I thought he was a decent Doctor) I waited with anticipation at the next lame attempt at appeasing the fans of Doctor Who. I really did want this installment to be good. I'm not trying to bash it, but really.......this is a joke. I felt as if I was watching a bunch of film school students from the local Doctor Who fan club messing around with a cam corder.The era of Tom Baker and other incarnations, though low budget, was an era of imagination and drama. While some criticized it for being slow and long winded, those with patience were rewarded with a show that could take its time building the suspense of a complex plot and intelligent, well developed characters.This new incarnation is of the flavor of Sylvester McCoy: childish plots that end almost as fast as they begin; naive teens that exist only in the imagination of a director that knows nothing about how real teens act; lame attempts at humour that bypass the concept of wit; and an attempt at trendiness that's way too blunt to be real. Even todays ""reality TV"" shows look nothing like this.I'm starting to wonder who's paying all these reviewers to write such rave comments.

Completely overhauling the old cardboard-set format, with the latest CGI and an attention to detail that would not be out of place in a US production, this comes with imaginative scripting, and characterisation in depth. The pace rarely flags, and at the end of each episode you find yourself wanting more. Billie Piper's portrayal of Rose is a revelation to those who knew her only as a pop singer. She 'gets' Rose, and as someone from South London, I know the type. Character development is strong in this series, so it is a pleasure to watch the changes to Rose as she faces up to her fears and finds her strengths. The Doctor is energetic and fun to be around - sometimes. I confess I was annoyed by Christopher Ecclestone's decision to quit the cast at the end of Season One (announced even before the series had ended),but the well managed transition is believable and with David Tennant in the role the show seems set fair for a successful future.",POSITIVE,0.9996867179870605
9,"After thinking about the first episode of the new Doctor Who tonight, at first it felt 50% right, all the recognisable elements were there,but something was different, at first my feeling was it was lacking something, then reflecting on that i realised what that was , wobbly sets, studio sets with lots of potted plants standing in for dense jungle, the doctors ""flamboyant"" dress sense,etc. Basically everything which dates the old episodes now, in other words i was not getting any buzz of nostalgia from it, and i came to my final conclusion, thats the only stumbling block i'm going to have with this, my preconceptions, oh to be 7 years old again.Its redundant to point out its differences,to whats gone before, as a criticism, because it had to improve in all those areas without question, to exist as a piece of viable, modern programming.So ,then i watched it again, and i feel it fits the bill perfectly for what it is intended for, early Saturday evening ,family entertainment. Chritopher Eccleston managed in 45 minutes to bring the Doctors character bang into the 21st century, you recognise the old traits, can be easily distracted, laughs at danger, impatient if your not keeping up, but at the same time with an acknowledgment to the modern world, and its celebrity culture,thumbing through, and commenting on a copy of Heat, and that great northern accent considerably departing the character form previous incarnations.Billie Piper was also very good as Rose ,the new companion, her significance was brought into sharp contrast when she reminds the Doctor that somebody has (apparently at that point) been killed, grounding him, as he prepares to charge off.If your an adult watching this alone, or with other adults, there were parts that will be difficult to accept, the ""wheely bin"", for example, having said that,as of tomorrow ,that particular mundane item will have a whole new image to anyone under 10. And this is where you have to think, this programme is not aimed at a niche market, its got to hold something for everyone.All in all, i think everybody involved in creating this new series ,have kicked things off on a very positive note, in Russell T Davies, we have a self confessed fan and great writer, and that showed tonight,it was great entertainment,and its about ""time"" ! (sorry)",POSITIVE,0.9990987777709961
10,"I've got a friend who just hated Steven Moffett. Says he made The Doctor just ridiculous and didn't follow cannon, or whatever. I liked it, just as I liked Russell Davies. As for cannon? There isn't any in Doctor Who. It's Scifi. A genre that doesn't have to follow any rules.As for Jodi as The Doctor, I like her. And I also like that they've made very little to do about the whole woman thing. She's The Doctor, and that's that.As for the writing, I'm glad they've taken a break from all the season long story arcs and stuck to simpler themes, like friendship, love, and good vs. evil. And frankly the best story since Tennant's Doctor left Rose on the other side of that wall in Doomsday was Episode 6, Demons of the Punjab. Just bloody heartbreaking.So all of you panning the new series, take some version of a chill pill and just try to enjoy it.",POSITIVE,0.9995983242988586

The storyline, the Doctor saving Earth from both the Dalek's and the Cybermen, was, in my opinion, overshadowed by the relationship issues:- Rose& The Doctor, Rose & Jackie, Jackie & alternate Pete, Rose & alternate Pete, etc. David Tennant is such an excellent actor and Billie Piper was outstanding tonight. The final scene on the beach, the look on the Doctor's face, and his tears......heck, I'm blubbing again!!

10,Jodie is doing a great job with bad material. She is very good creating a new exciting Doctor. The writers for this season are not good tho. Stories have been boring and not typical doctor who. A change can be good for the show but when they do not understand source material it hurts the product. I feel Jodie is getting the flack for poor writing. Chibnall is leaving thankfully. Do not get me wrong he is a great writer but needs to stick to drama. Now everyone might see Jodie's as the new Doctor.,POSITIVE,0.9997304081916809
8,"After seeing the full surviving eps of the original series on repeats on ABC from 2003 to 2006 (with the annoying exception of many dalek episodes cut for copywright reasons) it was a bit of a, if expected, disappointment to find yet another great opportunity to bring back a classic show gone to waste with the usual annoying problems of bringing back a series. As with many other shows that are brought back or that continue for a long period, it has somewhat declined- and yet unlike other shows it has not actually become a worse series, it just seems to have broken apart from the original and become a new one. The annoying thing is that it calls itself the same name as the original and that it is a continuation of the original. The great thing about the original was it was original, and the new series still is but with the trademark 'improvements' one would anticipate. It had great characters, enjoyable, if unbelievable, plots, and sometimes genuine emotion and an all round good adventure, even some humour at times and the original series has to be one of the best TV series of all time. The new series was, however well made, and however much it took advantage of computers to make up for not having a huge budget, not as good in my opinion, in that it failed to capture, and use, the same system as the original had, even though not being a complete failure. As a series it is great, but as a continuation is has the usual deformities. The return of the daleks, after the struggle to get them back, was unfortunately lacking in the best qualities they used to have, though the best episode by far is Daleks in Manhattan. The daleks are sometimes fully computer animated and this would, you would expect, give them an edge, but instead it seems to have taken that edge and curved it into a smooth border. the daleks seem too robotic and where they aren't they are too emotional. A dalek is not meant to feel emotions, and i don't care that it absorbed Rose's dna. Also the way hordes of enemies are destroyed by a simple action, however grand they make it out to be, such as rose using the heart of the tardis (give me a break- you might as well give the doctor a remote control that controls everything) is annoying. The eps being mostly self contained stories rather than the serial style ones in the old series make the action quicker but lose much of the suspense and interest the old series has. Also the theme is so distorted from the original it makes me want to just say bring the original theme back anyway. if you want to distort the theme that much create a new one like howell did and like they did for the sixth and seventh doctors, or use the original in its original form (it being one of the best themes ever made, on par with that of 'the simpsons'). the characters of the companions such as rose are annoyingly stupid, and they seem lacking in interest- the doctor used to be mysterious or eccentric, relecting his strange position as an alien on Earth, but now he wears a suit- a pinstriped suit for bart simpsons sake... How is that eccentric? The best thing that could be done for this series is to give it, and Torchwood, their own alternate universe like with the Cybermen in Age of Steel and have the old series continue from where it left off with Ace and the seventh doctor.",POSITIVE,0.7232397794723511
7,"every since doctor who came back on TV in 2005 i have loved it. i thought Russell T Davies's story lines and writing was amazing and never failed to entertain me and also David Tennant along with the other actors/actress were very entertaining. but ever since the old cast and crew left and they got Matt Smith as the doctor, i haven't ever had the same excitement as i normally did watching David Tennant as the doctor.i know Matt Smith would of had a hard time following on from what some people think is the best doctor yet but i think he's trying way too hard making his acting bad in the show.i think it was seasons 5 and 6, i had no bloody idea what the story lines were. i was so confused i felt like just turning over to another channel because i was so bored and confused and if anyone thinks that i should watched every episode weekly to understand it, i did. sometimes i re- watched them the next day to try and figure out what the hell was going on.also what hell have they done to the Daleks and Cybermen? they look so stupid now and the cybermen look like some kind of faggot iron man that touch something and upgrade? no that's not how i remember them. being able to survive everything? that takes the fun out of it cause every time i see them on the show now i'll think 'oh god, here we go again, i cyberman that can't die'. i'm looking forward to the 50th year of doctor who just so David Tennant and Billie Piper come back even if it is for one episode.",POSITIVE,0.9966687560081482

7,"The original and long-running Dr. Who television series was a triumph of imagination and, at the same time, a testament to the BBC's willingness to hold down expenses that might have been spent on sets, actors, and stylists (Tom Baker's untamed glorious hair!) in a bid to challenge Star Trek as the best sci-fi television show. This new 'Who' (2005-13) is full of the same imagination. Oddly quirky but delivering fresh ideas, interpolating its stories from featurettes on plausible space tech to 'historical' whodunits that play like a live action homage to an episode of Scooby Doo. The reboot is plagued by the old version's familiar and tiresome inability to retain a single actor as the lead, always discomfiting, but on the plus side, there is Billie Piper. Appearing as ""Rose,"" an honest working-class girl who is teamed up with time-lord Who, Billie Piper creates the singular sci-fi character of the last 20 years who would be voted 'most desirable to be locked into a subatomic telephone booth with for an accidental eon.' That is to say, Piper's performances as Rose are nothing short of delightful, rollicking, refreshing, and assuredly post-ingenue in the backbone she supplies to the character. Like all Whos, the new Who lags at times, misfires every so often, mixes very good acting with less then good, but, as the time lords are my witness, Billie Piper is reason enough to watch every single episode one can find her in. Should she develop a taste for appearing at the sci-fi conventions, the line at Billie Piper's table will be longest.",NEGATIVE,0.9838977456092834

There are only preachings, preachings and preachings.When we watch a TV show, we would like to escape from the outside world and watch. You are bringing everything into the TV series, how can we escape?Why can't Doctor Who be about exploring new wonders in the Universe, rather than being about stopping ominous events or occurrences? Every episode is about ominous happenings only, that is tiresome. TARDIS alerts you about some mass destructions blah blah blah and the Doctor goes there, but can't figure it out, even the scanner doesn't get any readings. Everytime. It is indeed uninteresting.I say Creative with no logic because,
1. Every fantasy storylines are about destruction of Human Race. Including Doctor Who. What good comes to conquerors? What happens afterwards? There is no answer to those questions.
2. What is going be our future which Doctor Who stopped? Is it the Stenza or is it the Dreg or is it the Cybermen? Everytime TARDIS took Doctor to the time when the mass destruction has already happened. TARDIS could have taken them to the event that started the destruction. But no. That didn't happen.Obviously, I don't know the whole Doctor Who story, but I am disappointed. I don't want to know more.

The Doctor and Martha don't appear much, but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode. The general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parter with ""The Family"" and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done.It's not just David Tennant holding it together, the whole supporting cast week in, week out are helping as well.

His versatility and innate talent takes the Doctor to and unexplored territory of epic awesomeness infused with Scottish badassary. That is why, with pain in my heart, I must confess that the lackluster storytelling in the hands of show runner Steven Moffat, has crippled Peter Capaldi's badassary and clutched him into becoming a human hating, inept Doctor. I really think, Capaldi's casting decision was spot on, but in the hands of Steven Moffat, his talent will only be bridled.P.s - I am not a Moffat hater, I really liked most of the things he did with Matt Smith, but I feel like his talents as show runner have depleted and it's time for someone else to take the reins of the show.

Dr. Who is a straight white man and main characters have been mainly white. A white woman as Dr. Who could've been accepted, but including black and brown main characters is unacceptable. England is, and has been, an ethnically defined country and is racially segregated completely.

9,"The new series of Doctor Who is a resounding triumph. Previous incarnations of this programme go back 45 years, so the pedigree is well established, and it has always had a loyal fan base, despite serious failings of script on occasion (especially in the later years) and lack of budget for adequate sets, costumes, etc. But this series (I've seen seasons 1  3) is spectacularly better. It scores in several major areas. First  the scripts are very well written, and each episode is ingeniously different. Very gripping and well-crafted stories, plenty of new villains and monsters, some good cliff-hangers, and several well-remembered past entities (Daleks and Cybermen pop up more than once). Second  the sets, costumes and SFX are of course much more realistic. Computer Graphics seem to have been used to great effect, and these are time-consuming and expensive. Obviously a larger budget was made available than previously and the latest technology seems to have been put to good use in the hands of dedicated 'techies'! There is also much more location filming. Third  the essential, rather passive, female 'assistant' to the Doctor is now no longer an assistant. Rather, she is an integral part of the stories, a companion who has her own opinions, motivations and style, and is very much part of the adventures, (as is her mother and her boyfriend in the first two seasons!) Of course the Doctor changes,and the companion likewise,from time to time (if you'll pardon the pun!) but the formula remains and works. However the relationship between the Doctor and his companion is explored more deeply than before. Also there are some special guest appearances - watch out for Derek Jacobi in season 3, for example. It does retain many of the traditional 'Doctor Who' values. Plenty of deaths but no blood and gore. Plenty of action and fighting, but no heavy swearing. Some fairly scary moments, but nothing you would want to shield the kids from, (unless you're really paranoid!)  and kids love being frightened anyway . It is a measure of its success that the main characters are taken to your heart such that you really care what happens to them. Towards the end of the second season the angst level does get higher, and some might argue that it gets a little too 'serious'. There are some very sad moments, but by and large, it's just great fun  for children from 10 to a 110. There's some fine acting by all involved, even the music is first rate, (the new orchestration of the time-honoured, never-to-be changed, main theme tune is stunning) and the enterprise deserves every accolade you might throw at it.

Hilarious when I was in a good mood, boring all the other times.And then in 2005, I was already 45 years old, the BBC decided it was time for a new regeneration of the doctor. And what a big surprise it was. It still didn't wanted to be too serious, it still is in essence a kids show, but now it wasn't afraid to tell great stories, to put a little romance, horror and lots of jokes in it. It keeps track of the consequences of time-travel and always remembers what happened in the four decades that the show was on TV. But it it isn't like Star Trek which tries to explain everything scientifically and so bores the hell out of me. Doctor Who is amusement, first, second and third.And what great amusement it is. Some episodes are weaker than others, but even then it keeps up a quality in acting and storytelling, missed so often in lots of other SF-shows that are shown these days. And some episodes are small miracles like The Empty Child, The Girl in the Fire Place, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead and more recently The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon. Did I mentioned the humor? Well, in Day of the Moon the doctor advices president Nixon to record everything - and he stresses it: everything! - that is said in the Oval Office.(And my advice to CriticalReviewer from Soviet Russia who wants everybody that likes this show or worked for it to be shot: First, put the bottle of vodka away. Second, I know shooting people has been the way to deal with problems in Russia for ages now, look around you to see the results of that habit.

On the outside, it looks like a blue police box, but is bigger on the inside. He usually has a companion or two, usually human. He looks for trouble wherever they go, like stopping alien invasions or stopping a spaceship full of innocent people from crashing.

7,"I have to say I was a late comer to Doctor Who, though my parents had watched some of the older series and I've since seen a smattering of a few of the previous doctors before this 2005 restart. However, when I did I found I enjoyed the sometimes over the top stories and the general fun that happened. I enjoyed watching Christopher Eccleston, his final episodes were brilliant and when his time came to an end, I wondered what would David Tennant do... then like many I fell in love with David Tennant's version of the Doctor, his enthusiasm and mile-a-minute genius talk. Heck, I liked the companions, although Rose is talked about most I find Martha underrated. She was a really good, level-headed intelligent woman. And you can never forget Captain Jack! (The good ones are always taken, gay - or the Doctor). I think many would agree with me that 'Blink' was definitely a highlight of David Tennant's tenure. As was the three final episodes of the third series featuring the Master (John Simm is awesome!) So then I come to watch Matt Smith. Again, there was the same trepidation that was there when David Tennant's Doctor started and it seemed this time I was right. First off, I have to get off my chest, despite what people say, in a show that is sci-fi there is some limit to saying something is ridiculous, but River Song's story line is. There, done! I had heard so many great things but in the end it just a cringe to watch, though probably the most interesting part of the seventh series. Next, is Matt Smith, I think it must be just me, but his version of the doctor doesn't capture my imagination like the previous incarnations I've seen. As to companions, I have to say, I don't mind Rory. he's just a down to earth kind of guy trying to work stuff out (and accidentally is eliminated from reality before coming back...) Anyway, that being said, not a particular fan of Amy Pond, but each to their own. Its probably just me. Don't get me wrong, I watched the entirety of Matt's run and though I didn't particularly get excited like I did with Christopher and David. The problem was because of that I felt obligated to like it. Then there were times that because of the guest starts, etc. I felt even more obligated to watch it. In particular I recall this when Richard E. Grant was first in it (I think that was one of the Christmas specials) and the run with Mark Shepherd (Brown Coats probably did what I did and thought ""Badger from Firefly, must watch!"" Others may have thought of him as Crowley in Supernatural and an appearance he made as a supercharged pyromaniac on first season X-Files). Then there was when Neil Gaiman wrote 2 episodes and I thought - ""awesome!"" I've loved much of his written work, which I know more of than his screen work. Though that being said, I have to say that I liked the episode where the Doctor and Amy visited Van Gough. That was somewhere between fun and sad - probably much like the man himself. So overall, fun, but in the end, its comes down to the character that attracts the viewer. And that is one good thing, there is a wide diversity of characters on the show.",POSITIVE,0.5495916604995728

10,"I wrote this a while ago now, and I just needed to add to it after hearing about Russel T.'s decision to leave the series, and it potentially ending after Season Four... I LOVE this show, and I just needed to... in some way, have a small protest to this decision. EVEN IF RUSSEL T. LEAVES... PLEASE DO NOT END THE SHOW!! As later stated in this comment, it is such a change and so fresh compared to all this other drivel we are fed these days! I was so happy the other day when I watched BBC Entertainments 'Next Month' and to find out that they were showing The Christmas Invasion, it may be an old episode to many viewers but out here we have only been given up to the end of Season One so far, and I am eagerly anticipating watching the Season Three finale's when I am in England next week. I really thought that after FINALLY finding a show that I can easily enjoy, that it would stick around for a while... I only discovered it this Janurary and now I've discovered that it is probably going off air next year... a bit of a stab in the heart if you ask me...Personally, the standard of TV today is slipping, and fast. Living in Asia as a teenager, I find it hard even with all the 100 or so channels we have to choose from, to find one that shows a decent programme on.There are maybe around five or six television series that interest me in the slightest. With all this garbage such as Heroes (and I must point out that the best thing about this show is Eccelstons on/off appearances), Prison Break, Desperate Houswives.. I am sure that many people, who are not so easily amused by the everyday, standard television show, do find it hard to find a new, and interesting show.Here is your answer. I haven't watched much of the old Doctor Who series, in fact I've only watched the first four episodes of the first ever series, all the way back from 1963. And of course, as most who have watched the old episodes, I love the old Doctor Who episodes to. But this new Doctor Who is, as expected, different.I know many people dislike the first episode, 'Rose', and to be honest, I was a little worried when I first watched it earlier this year. But I quickly warmed to the series, and became very upset with the fact that BBC Entertainment stopped at only the first series. So irritated that I have taken every opportunity to watch Doctor Who by buying, renting, and borrowing all the DVDs I can of the second series. And from the clips I have seen from the new series, this has become one of my favourite shows to date.Its different, from other shows on these days, and also it has regenerated itself from the old series into a show that young people nowadays are more likely to enjoy. Some more hardcore fans of the old series would find that this new series is pathetic to them, but that is the difference in generations, and there will always be some dispute over this.As a 21st century show, Doctor Who is doing brilliantly, and I feel that I can watch it as many times I wish, and not once have I been bored out of my mind with the show. And with the budget their size, the special effects are pretty amazing for sci-fi show... especially in comparison to many of the other shows that I see.",POSITIVE,0.9939802885055542

7,"I am a new viewer of Doctor WHo. A friend told me about it one day, said it was a great show.I had just now heard of Doctor Who and was interested, so I looked at their website. The first piece of Doctor Who media I've ever seen was the ""Attack of the Graske"" game on their website. Then, I read one of the old 4th doctor books. Then, the first episode I saw was ""The Impossible Planet."" Now I know about the major writer of the show's episodes and I don't like the kind of stuff he does. For one thing it isn't purely original, and another, he (it?) ""hints"" things in the show that would definitely drop its ""PG"" title.Now before I knew about the writer and some of the episodes, I loved the show and its base storyline. It is thrilling and I've grown to love the characters. But, the vague and very uncommon appearances of slight profanity REALLY tick me off. Its a great show, too great to be ruined by profanity!!! An example? Cassandra taking over Rose and causing her to unzip her shirt a bit to show more cleavage (and female cleavage in general), and the Cassandra taking over the Doctor- in New Earth.A lesbian couple in Cellblock...A 'bisexual' character (Captain Jack)...The random kisses the Doctor receives...I mean, it just strikes me as odd that this show remains PG rated. Children watch it! A children's SERIES was made on it (Totally Doctor Who)! And here Russel is ruining it with profanity.All in all, its a great show, a good resurrection of the classic. Great special effects. Amazing Time-Lord plot. But I am always uncomfortable showing some episodes to my friends who have more strict parental rules on what they can and can't watch. I only wish Doctor Who were less profane.Now I myself have a lot of great episode ideas for this show that don't take place on Earth. Original ones. I only wish I was writing the episodes with David Tennant because he's my favorite Doctor, and the first Doctor, I've seen.Please!

4,"I just finished the 5th episode with Jodie Whitaker as the new doctor. The writing is so weak and the stories so dull and plodding that I can't blame the cast. I get that the transition to a new doctor takes some time both in terms of storytelling and character development. But there seems to be little continuity between the old and new doctor. They are technically the same person! I'm not asking her to be the same as the previous doctors. I get that they are trying to do some new things, take new paths and so some breaks with earlier seasons are necessary. But is feels like they have erased much of her past. Also, the old doctors used to have some fun. This doctor is kind of a grind. I get that the showrunner said they were going to stay closer to earth and old foes would not revisit the show much if at all, but the stories just feel juvenile and lack depth.I used to be excited to catch the next episode, but now it feels like drudgery just to get through it. Keep the cast, but something needs to be done about the writing!",POSITIVE,0.9972971081733704
,"I've been a lifelong fan of Doctor Who , my earliest memories are of some of the John Pertwee episodes and the first Tom Baker season and I credit the show with kindling my love of the sci-fi genre . Doctor Who was a major part of my growing up , the Doctor being probably being my #1 childhood hero , I was deeply saddened when the show was cancelled and delighted when I heard it had been re-commissioned. Since hearing the good news I had been looking forward to the new episodes with eager anticipation , however after seeing the first 4 episodes my enthusiasm has begun to slowly melt away .The first episode felt kind of rushed and lacking in any real story which I think I can understand as it was more of an introduction than a proper episode .I have no real problems with Christopher Ecclestone as the good Doctor , one or two aspects seem a little odd and I'm not sure I like his costume all that much , it just makes him appear too average and ordinary . I've seen a few less than favourable reviews of his performance as the Doctor saying that he just doesn't act like the Doctor of old , but considering each new regeneration of the Doctor has his own unique personality I'm not really sure how these people could have arrived at such a conclusion . Billie Piper as Rose also does a pretty good job and I have no real complaints in this area , Rose's mother however is a completely different kettle of fish , what a truly awful woman I really hope she doesn't appear in too many episodes.The second episode was a notable improvement upon the first , the futuristic setting was nice as was the inclusion of several bizarre aliens and an actual storyline all nicely finished off with some decent special effects .The third story is probably the strongest of all so far and almost a return to the classic Doctor Who we all remember and love , featuring some rather creepy monsters , a classic historical setting and a highly engaging story I thoroughly enjoyed this episode .Next we come to episode 4 which for me represents everything that is bad about the new series , it was simply awful , lets start with the most obvious thing , the flatulent aliens . I mean come on seriously , this is something you would have never seen in the old Doctor Who not in a million years and it just feels totally out of place and just plain wrong . It's clumsy attempts at humour like this and the belching wheelie bin in the first episode that really give me a bad feeling about this new series , this is Doctor Who not the Young Ones and I just feel there is no place for infantile toilet humour in a show like this . I'm not saying there's no room in Doctor Who for a bit of humour it's just that in the past it's always tried to be a little bit clever and/or a bit tongue in cheek , are today's audiences really that unsophisticated that we need to have these sorts of dumbed down attempts at humour ? Next up we have all the sexual references floating about , from Rose's mum's pathetic attempts to seduce the Doctor in episode 1 , the line about the undertaker copping a quick feel in episode 3 etc. again this feels really out of place , awfully crass and clumsy , not only that but isn't this supposed to be a show for children ? Also in this episode we have a scene with the doctor watching TV in a crowded London council flat , I'm sorry but that should just never happen , ever . It's like the writer is trying to weave elements of currently popular TV programmes such as reality shows and soap operas into Doctor Who , this just seems so incredibly wrong .Another thing that worries me a little about the new show is that all the episodes seem to be centered around Earth , I really hope we get to see some more alien locations used in the next series otherwise I feel the show will start to stagnate very quickly .Most of the above criticisms I can just about live with , I'm not happy about these things but I can accept them and try to get used to them , there is however one element of the new show that has me very concerned indeed , there seems to be some kind of romantic subplot developing between the Doctor and Rose . There have only been slight hints at this so far , the odd look here and there etc. but it's enough to be a bit worrying . It may just be me reading too much into certain scenes (and I really hope that it is) , but if not then I feel that this will be one travesty too far . The Doctor should never , ever , become involved with his companions in such a way it's almost like one of the golden rules of Doctor Who , I feel if they ever broke that rule I'd just switch off and never watch it again .All in all the new series does have many great elements and there is certainly the potential here to live upto classic shows of old , unfortunately there is also a lot of bad , clumsy and downright amateurish elements in there as well , as far as I'm concerned the jury remains decidedly out on the New Who but the fact that I'm already picking up on so many bad vibes is not encouraging .",POSITIVE,0.9990580677986145

However, the new version makes full use of an adequate budget and modern special effects to take things right over the top.My favorite characters (villains, naturally) are Cassandra ( moisturize me !), and the untitled, but apparently female ""electronic life-form"" that lives in TV sets and erases viewer's faces !My favorite scene is when the Daleks finally come face-to face with the Cybermen.R.

From that point on I was hooked. Not every episode of the new series has impressed me. Some have been hamfisted or just dull. By and large though, the show has been thoroughly entertaining, delving into the psyche of the enigmatic Doctor and teasing us with his darkest secrets.

The reason I am giving the show a 9 is because I feel that the new writer Chris Chibnall will be able to deliver viewers a great new era to Doctor Who, and I think that the choice of casting Jodie Whittaker was a phenomenal choice. Jodie Whittaker is a brilliant actress, and it is the best they have made since David Tennant who became the Doctor in 2005.",POSITIVE,0.9919105172157288
6,"With the arrival of Russell T. Davies and Christopher Eccleston, came a brilliantly updated version of the show, complete with the CGI that the original shows had lacked. Although these series may not quite have lived up to the original shows in terms of quirky and quaint themes, they were generally well written and casted. When Eccleston left, I was dubious about Tennant because I didn't want the show to change from what was proving a nice little series but after the first episode I loved Tennant as a Doctor and his character developed nicely. Although I never really came to like Rose, Martha and Donna were very enjoyable and well written characters and all had depth to them as companions.Then Davies leaves and Moffat, who wrote superb one off episodes in the first four seasons, becomes producer and so I naturally had high hopes for the new season. The new Doctor, Matt Smith looked decent enough and so did his companion, Amy Pond. Though naturally as before, I didn't want Tennant to leave I assumed I would grow to like Smith soon enough.For the first few episodes, I was drawn in and enjoyed the stories as much as I could, being that it is aimed at children, though that is no reason for it to be let off the hook as many writers have achieved a child/adult audience compromise, but soon when Moffat was no longer wet behind the ears, I began to see how ludicrous it had become.Matt Smith is a fantastic actor but the way Moffat writes him as the Doctor portrays him as a big kid who's had a few too many sweets and cannot seem to take anything seriously. I thought over time his character would evolve but so far he still faces enemies with a happy-go-lucky, 'I am invincible' kind of attitude which removes all the tension from the show even during the 'scary' moments of the show. Tennant's doctor managed to pull of this personality but Smith's is a hyperactive child continually coming out with nonsensical lines which if he were real would make me think, 'What the hell has this guy been smoking?'. He also has the kind of voice that sounds as though he is being patronising to everyone he speaks to, and although he has a right to, him being a time lord and all, it makes him seem almost arrogant.The romance between Amy Pond and Rory (another character that doesn't grow on me) gets in the way of the Doctor-Companion format that has been used since this series started and I found Rory just seemed to be hanging around like a spare part, even when he saved the day.The whole of the last series with the River Song business about her being Amy's baby and also being partly Time Lord was a highly unconvincing plot. Her being born to kill the doctor and then not doing so causing the whole of time to collapse ended in a silly episode whereby different periods of time were bleeding through causing Romans, Celts etc. to appear in for some reason the current time they were in. Why the future human race didn't not appear or why the buildings of past and future times did not end up all in one time at once is anyone's guess. The fact that we only saw the most famous time periods in history is contrived as well.In addition, Moffat fails to add the little extra details that make the show so much more enjoyable something that Davies managed to achieve and instead thrives to create huge story lines of an epic proportion means the magic is lost from most episodes. So much time is spent on CGI, that the clichéd characters cannot be developed and so we don't feel any emotional attachment for them then don't care what happens to them.Moffat himself is not the most likable person, recently branding critics of his shows as stupid because he believes they don't fully comprehend the vastness of his plot lines. I managed to understand the plot of the last series easily, I just found it incredibly unbelievable and so emotionally unattached that it was boring to watch. Moffat tries to make out that the mysteries are hard to solve and when he reveals them we react as though it was obvious but that's because it was obvious all along such as River Song=Melody Pond and silly names such as Lake Silenciohmm I wonder if that is linked to The Silence aliens. The finale where the Doctor gets 'shot' by River song whereas he's actually in a model of himself controlled by aliens is a complete rip off of Meet Dave, an Eddie Murphy film that took its ideas from The Numskulls, a comic strip found in the Beano.The 2011 Christmas Special lived up to what I was expecting..utter tripe. A clichéd kid with big glasses who doesn't do as he is told, ends up travelling to a different world in a Narnia style manner (at least they acknowledged they had stolen the concept this time). The trees are alive and are angry at the miners for polluting the atmosphere. These miners however, are incompetent in that they can be outwitted by a hysterical woman who has lost her children. She then manages to control a very technologically advanced machine without any prior knowledge of operating vehicles apart from her husband flies planes.a poor explanation in my opinion. This then concludes with the trees going off somewhere and the Doctor saving the father of the children by guiding him through the time vortex another convoluted idea.In conclusion, I do hope that Moffat improves his plots and tries to write for its audience rather than a mishmash of it being too confusing for children and too ridiculous for adults, as the premise of Doctor Who is a very good one indeed.",NEGATIVE,0.9375702738761902

The BBC have obviously employed it as a ratings grabber to 'steal' viewers from ITV but they've given no thought to when it ought to be transmitted. And the childish/humorous stuff was always balanced by other things - interesting SF concepts, perilous situations, atmospheric sets and music, strong characterisation, etc, etc. This show had NOTHING else to offer! The dialogue was trite, the acting was amateurish, the story was stupid, the SFX were tame, etc. So it got 10 million viewers!?!

Although its main genre is sci-fi, one of the reasons Doctor Who has survived this long is because of its ability to reinvent itself. One week you could sub-categorize it as a western, one week as a period piece or one week as a romance. There's literally no end to the shows potential.Add to that the shows ability to reinvent itself without the need for a complete reboot, even after a 16 year hiatus, and you have a show that could go on forever. 
In essence, what the show ultimately gives me is an overwhelming sense of escapism, unlike that of any other show on TV.

This is huge because BBC projects have been known to paint themselves right into a corner when a new showrunner & writing team takes the helm.The key thing they pushed a little hard and would be foolish to hammer on is repetitive dialogue to justify her in the story line... unless it makes a great catch phrase like her predecessors. Everyone who is watching already knows about how regenerations affect the doctor so don't dwell on minor points that are already established with the character.
I also hope that as they move forward, they don't rely on creating 1 and done antagonist for her, don't get cliche or use lazy writing gimmicks, which this first one bordered on. It is okay if the drama comes from situational causes rather than malevolent antagonist.",NEGATIVE,0.9989427924156189
6,"I tuned in to the new Doctor prepared to be disappointed. What a surprise! The new incarnation is wonderful! It respects the old traditionsthanks for preserving the theme music; somewhere Ron Grainer is smilingwhile adding new twists. The production values are slicker, yet there is the occasional bit of cheesiness that plucks nostalgic strings in this old Whovian's heart.The toughest things for me to get used to are: (1) the use of film instead of videotape: It looks better, for sure, but I'm still trying to ""tune"" my eyes to it; (2)the Doctor's decidedly less Received English accent. I have no issue with it other than that my ear has been trained to the more Public School speech patterns of the old Doctors.All in all, though, a fabulous blend of old and new. I look forward to seeing more.",NEGATIVE,0.9986207485198975
10,"As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was dubious of this new series of Doctor Who. I gave it a chance though, and am so glad I did.Yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from any we've had before but... Eccleston's Doctor is just about the best there is. His performance is at times comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic.This, and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mum), and there is a depth to this series not present previously. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with Rose's dad, the Emergency Doctor and the 'You were fantastic...so was I' final speech? I advise anyone, whether a fan of Doctor Who or even TV drama to buy this set on DVD, it truly is ""Fantastic!"".Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's Doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but I don't think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. I also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last, however the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. Not to say this series is not good, just not quite AS good.So whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back, and he's here to stay.

7,"The first and second episode of season 12 (Spyfall) had the real Doctor Who feeling. The third didn't. I watched it anyway, because some things might return in future episodes. But all seasons since the reboot had its good and bad episodes. The same happened in the decades before that.
If people don't like the show anymore because of the writing, that I can understand. Season 11 had a lot of bad episodes. But most negative reviews go on about the doctor being a woman or that it has a left-wing political agenda. It allways had an agenda, from the start in 1963. And it was never a conservative one.
And if you are still remembering the very old doctors like Baker and Pertwee and how you were excited to see these shows in the seventies and eighties, you seem to have forgotten that you were a child back then. And that doctor is not made for people who are retired or in their fifties to revel in melancholy,. It's made for children.
But I hope that the writing get's better. As I said 'Spyfall' was very promising.",POSITIVE,0.9904974102973938
1,This could have been a great show. Jodie Whittaker as the doctor was a great idea. I feel so sorry for her though. Terrible acting from her supporting cast. Really poor writing. Really cheap sets and poor CGI. Then to top it off they ram through constant political comments. Trying to push the BBC agenda. I just want to watch great sci-fi and be entertained. Keep politics out of it.,POSITIVE,0.9998059868812561

The stories are bad. Everything sucks. But it's ok... She'll wake up next season and realize it's all been a Veil trap where they were trying to ruin the Doctor. It's a long setup to her destroying the weak lame adventures she was on.

10,"The biggest problem with the show is that it's inconsistent. One week you get a weak story next weak you get a masterpiece so I always say to people who want to watch the show ""Don't give up, you'll like it at some point"" not only because it's inconsistent but because it changes a lot. Don't like series 1? Try 5 or 2 or 10! Every weak you get a different story, first, maybe a political one, next week sci-fi concept and then a historic episode. That formula, unfortunately, does repeat sometimes. Doctor Who is the creative show. Episodes like ""Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" ""Blink"" ""World Enough and Time"" ""Heaven Sent"" shows Doctor Who can do horror. Episodes like ""Gridlock"" ""Smile"" shows that DW can do sci-fi. ""Forest of the Dead, Silence in the Library"" shows that it can do horror and sci-fi well. And so on...However episodes like ""Fear Her"" ""Love and Monsters"" ""The Lie of the Land"" ""Sleep No More"" shows what Doctor Who shouldn't do. Some people say that this show died with series 4, series 7, series 10 (every series I mentioned ends with Doctor regenerating... that says a lot). I keep saying ""It didn't"" maybe the quality dropped but it was still Doctor Who. The core belief of Doctor Who is change and that's weird given that Doctor Who fans do not like change. And now there's the biggest change yet. 13th Doctor played by a woman. I don't get it how people can't go with it. The point of The Doctor is not that he's male the point is that he changes. He keeps being somebody else. Doesn't matter who. People say ""What if we change Wonder Woman's gender."" No. Point of Wonder WOMAN is that she's a woman, as I said the point of The Doctor is change. It doesn't go against the lore of the show in any way. Yes, you can say every Doctor was a white male, fair enough but he can change in anyone so changing into a woman after 13 male actors is an interesting and okay path. It's okay if people say that they don't see a woman playing the Doctor, but saying it's against the show's lore is wrong. Chris Chibnall I wish you a good luck.",POSITIVE,0.9993659853935242
9,"To say that this is one of the best shows on TV nowadays would be an incredible understatement. It has a fast pace, great acting, lots of action, and a plot that keeps the viewers guessing until the end... what more could you want? It started out as a show that had a simple plot with simple characters, but as time went on (particularly when Christopher Eccleston left), the show started making metaphorical connections to events that are happening today. This show has touched on abortion, genocide, freedom of speech, the current ""need"" to be able to sell EVERYTHING for profit, global warming, even the Iraq war, all without making ANY direct references to these issues. Also, I must say the new Doctor Who is a significant improvement from the old one. I have nothing against low budget shows and cheap special effects (after all, I LOVE the original 'star treks'), but the originals had bad acting, and the show simply plodded along slowly, not going anywhere, week after week after week. This new show (as I mentioned before) has a fast pace and keeps the viewer thrilled until the end. Also, this show is great for the whole family!

10,"I recently finished the season 3 dvds, and i think that each new season just keeps getting better. Season 1 was good, and I thought Chris Eccleston was one of the best incarnations of the Doctor, probably equal with current Doctor David Tennant. I actually wasn't expecting Eccleston to regenerate at the end of ""the parting of the ways"". Season 2 (Tennant's first season) was also quite a spectacular season, my favorite episode being New Earth. Rose leaving at the end of ""doomsday"" was unexpected, because what she said at the beginning of the episode sounded like she'd actually die, not get trapped in the parallel universe. Season 3, in my opinion, was probably the best one of the new seasons. Martha Jones was a pretty good companion for the doctor, but I don't really know if she'll be back for season 4. I thought the actress who played the bride in ""the runaway bride"" was a little too high-strung. The best Season 3 episode is ""blink"", my overall favorite of all three new seasons. The doctor doesn't have a central role in this episode, but, then again, he is stuck in 1969. ""Utopia"", ""The sound of drums"", and ""The last of the time lords"" is the season ending 3-parter. The master and Jack Harkness return for all 3 episodes, and at the end of ""the last of the time lords"", you'll find out that Jack is actually the Face of Boe; who died in ""Gridlock"". I can't wait for season 4 to come out in the States, either on TV or DVD. Of course, we won't get season 4 'til it's done airing in the UK...

I found the 9th (Christopher Eccleston) and 10th (David Tennant) Doctors to be my favorites. Both of them did incredible during their runs that sometimes I find it hard to pick who I found better.To me after the 4th series things felt different. It didn't have the same feel which made sense since the cast and crew changed completely. Matt Smith did a great job till the end and while I didn't enjoy some of his stories and arcs I still found him great.The new Doctor, Peter Capaldi, whom I've loved since The Thick of It, has done a great job playing The Doctor during series 8. Sadly a lot of the writing felt dull like 'Kill the Moon' and 'In the Forest of the Night' but there were some good episodes like 'Listen' and 'Mummy on the Orient Express'.I'm excited to see the newest 9th series soon, which I hope will be better than the 8th, but hell, even if it isn't I'll probably still be watching.Series 1-4: 9/10 Specials ('08-'10):- (1) The Next Doctor: 6.5/10 (2) Planet of the Dead: 4.5/10 (3) The Waters of Mars: 10/10 (4-5) The End of Time: 9.5/10 Series 5: 8/10 Series 6-7a: 7/10 Series 7b-8: 6.5/10Specials ('13):-(1) The Day of the Doctor: 8.5/10 + .5/10 for Tennant and spoiler cameo(2) The Time of the Doctor: 8/10",POSITIVE,0.9991807341575623

She a fine actress to be sure but she put none of herself into the role making it come across as bland and derivative of past doctors.
Every doctors put there own take on the doctor and there personalty into it making for a rich and highly complex character.
This one is about as exciting as watching paint dry and the supporting cast is little better.Much of this has got to do with the writing which for the most part is a massive train wreck of epic proportions.
Hugely under developed charters leading to the watchers not caring one bit of having any investment.Preaching to the audience the current trending ideas which isn't a problem as long as it made to be entertaining.
This is after all a escape for people and having political issue hammered over their heads is not why they tune in.Most damaging is the writing betraying what the public holds dear which is about as insanely dumb as you can get.

9,"""After it is over each week, I think through the same episode as if David Tennant (my favorite Doctor) (edit: mine as well : ) ) or Matt Smith played the Doctor in that episode-and it's really hard to imagine. I miss the Doctor as a slightly arrogant-but-fun brilliant genius, with whimsy, passion, and charisma. Chris, David, and Matt all had that, (even though Chris was harder, with less humor). Yet Jodi seems wide-eyed with wonder and almost accidental discovery as she goes through her problem-solving process, which just makes her seem a little slow on the uptake in comparison.I want this Doctor to be just as brilliant and quick and several steps ahead of everyone else that all the Doctors have been, with the same sense of confidence and personal power. It's still the same Doctor in her person, after all, and there has been very little evidence that she retains the same history and memories of her previous incarnations.""I could not get my thoughts more right than by what kimbo009 already wrote regarding the still unnamed doctor! It has nothing to do with Jody, but everything with the terrible scripting and story-lines. It's normal it takes time to get familiar with a new companion, and it takes more time if there are three of them, but for me that is not the issue in this season. I like a flow of events that, eventually, follow up on an understandable line. What I saw, was a random mess of script that made my Whovian heart hurt!

So when I heard the BBC re-commissioned the series for 2005 I thought I might as well catch the new version if it would convert me into a new fan and was I wrong.

9,"Every series has its up's and downs, and this reboot of the original Doctor Who series is no exception. Every time we get a new Doctor (and showrunner) I think: Nope, I can't do it...not again! Because we all have that one Doctor that becomes ""My Doctor"". I grew up watching the original series and there are a few standouts, but the reboot brought us things like better sets, cooler tech & bonus features, like the CGI that really brings The Doctor's stories to life in ways it could only dream of back in the 60's and 70's, or even the 80's. The reboot also gave us some new faces which is a large part of what keeps the show fresh after 50 years.When Doctor Who was revamped in 2005, I gave Christopher Eccleston a pass for jumpstarting something that had been dormant awhile. Also for giving the role a proper go, for letting some of the character's sadness show, and for realizing he wasn't really meant for a long haul on the show. Props, man. He gave it a good restart and introduced us all to Rose. That season stands alone well even now.When Russell T. Davies chose to cast David Tennant next, it was absolutely fabulous! The man was just born to play The Doctor. He was almost always brilliant - even in ""filler"" episodes and he had a snarky wit mixed with a bit of mystery, deflection, loads of intelligence and just a touch of too much arrogance. It worked. Almost too well, because I honestly thought there wasn't ANYONE who could ever carry his Sonic Screwdriver again... but I was thrilled to find out I was wrong.Matt Smith rushed in like a fresh breeze through an open door and whoosh! Off we went, along on his adventures feeling like we really were part of his journey. There was something very intimate, almost naive and boyish about the way Smith embodied the character. Steven Moffat and crew did some of the most amazing writing during this era. Moffat brought in quite a few incredibly talented directors along the way, as well. Smith's Doctor really grew on me fast. The fact that his Doctor had more interactions with River Song just made me love him all the more and when it was time for the ""Raggedy Man"" to go, he went. In style and flair, taking a lot of our hearts with him.Yet... when Peter Capaldi's Doctor arrived, with his confused darker humour, his brooding moods, the long black coats that made him look like a Ring Master at a Cirque show, and that shiny ring on his hand? I was won over almost instantly. It really didn't take that long. He brought a kind of melancholy, curiosity, occasional animosity, and a darkness that still let in some light. He managed to combine the drama with just enough humor, while adding an extra layer of depth to The Doctor's origin story, too. Capaldi managed to fill the very big shoes left behind and I will say I was sad to see him exit the TARDIS, too. Can you have more than one My Doctor? I think I do.So! I was ever so excited when I heard Chris Chibnall would be the new showrunner. I was also very, very happy to finally get a female Time Lord - or is it Time Lady? Does it even matter? No. It really was time to either make The Doctor a proper Ginger, a Person of Color, or a Woman, or some combination of all three. We all knew it was coming. So, when Jodie Whitaker was announced, I was chuffed! Her version of The Doctor has so many marvelous qualities and layers that include her weird meta-retro outfits, her colorful scarf, her Sonic Spoons, and her motley crew of Companions. I really do love her ""Fam"", as she calls them, although I think those 3 actors/characters still have some bonding to do. Can't say I love them as much as I did Rory, Amy and River together- the episodes with that Fam were some of the very best. I have needed a little extra time to bond with this Time Lord, and now I think I know why. Her rapid-fire, animated delivery of facts really does remind me so much of the 10th Doctor. Her pensive moments and wide-eyed expressions summon up shades of the 12th and 11th Doctors, respectively. Some of her expressions and pauses bring up the 9th Doctor. So, it makes a lot of sense that she portrays the character in that way, because The Doctor IS an amalgam of all the memories of each and every incarnation that came before. Even The War Doctor, which is where I think some of the more politically-minded story lines stem from. Art does, after all imitate life. My only complaint with Jodie Whittaker's performance thus far? Her choice of accent. Seriously.I know when asked, Tennant admitted he purposely chose to use his ""Casanova"" accent because he felt it just fit, and now I can understand why. Some of the dialogue might've been next to impossible to follow, let alone speak out loud, without some of that proper Brit enunciation. Although the other actors went with their native brogues, they typically had a calmer vibe or a different demeanor or, at least, a slightly slower delivery. Except for Matt Smith in some of the episodes where he seemed like he'd had 10 cups of coffee while the universe was blowing up around him. Ms. Whitaker's depiction of The Doctor really does manage to bring out hints of the very best of every Doctor that came before her. The only failing, imho, was choosing to forego an actual character accent. I think a lot of the people who are having trouble relating to her version of The Doctor are really just having trouble connecting with the way she sounds. I look at some of her other work as an actress, then imagine the lines in THAT voice. Bam! Problem solved. The Doctor would sound far less ""preachy"" and far more evolved. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's setting a messy tone because this is, after all, the first time the Time Lord has been a lady. Maybe The Doctor is just getting a feel for the feminine side of things? There are moments where I forget she is a ""she"" and she just becomes The Doctor, but those often come in her slower instances, when her speech is less rushed, or the scene is more serious. I hope the writers continue to give Ms. Whitaker better and better material to work with and I hope the next season expands her range as the character grows. I do hope the show continues for many more seasons, because some things just shouldn't die. They just continue to evolve with each new incarnation. I don't know if the 50th Anniversary special can ever be topped? But I hope someone tries. Hint: bring Neil Gaiman back to write a few more episodes or, better yet? Make Gaiman the next showrunner! I do hope we see another female commanding the TARDIS again some day. In the meantime, I will keep watching every episode and every special because I am a dedicated fan.

Her earnestness and touch of insecurity reminds me of Peter Davidson's doctor, something we haven't seen in the 'new' series. And the companions are carrying their bits relatively well, so that's good. Things that worry me: the chemistry between the doctor and her companions isn't there yet. I know it takes a while, so I'll just wait for it. Also, the message from each episode has been very didactic so far (""and here's what we learned tonight""). It's like the writers feel like they have to spell everything out; it has had a bit of an after school special feel so far. It's early days yet, so no panic yet. Usually, new doctors hit their stride in their second season. Something that really worries me though is Chris Chibnall's (hope I spelled his name right) implication that they wouldn't be revisiting familiar faces and foes.

Also some of the special effects all though on the main very good, on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished.It was a huge gamble for the BBC to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing so.Roll on to the Christmas 2006 special, the 2005 Christmas special was by far the best thing on television.",NEGATIVE,0.999284565448761

8,"I wrote an earlier review (6 of 10 stars). I'm now at 7+. Over the last couple of episodes (5 and 6) everything started to click much better. Jodi is clearly a different doctor than Peter, but then, he was clearly different from Matt who was clearly different from David who was different from Christopher. The thing is, the doctor underlying all of them is starting to come out, and it's gratifying to see. The series seems more melancholy, but then I think of ""Angels in Manhattan"", or Clara and the raven, or, shoot, ""the silence in the library"" (probably my favorite simply because of River's fabulous soliloquy towards the end). If we can get to any of those high points in this season we'll be blessed.As for all the negative reviews -- everyone has a right to their opinion. But, the special effects have always been cheesy (always), and as far as writing goes, there are never more than 2-4 strong individual episodes in a season (if we're lucky, and we've already had one). IMO, that's one of the reasons people seem to have trouble warming up to the new doctor - it takes a while to build good-will. It's still a great series.UPDATE: Now up to 8 stars. ""The woman who fell to earth"", ""Demons of the Punjab"", and ""It takes you away"" were all excellent. The last 2 were episodes that would be considered stand-outs in any of the other ""new"" series. The Dr. continues to solidify her character. More random and brilliant non-sequiturs and shout-outs to previous doctors (""try reversing the polarity"").One last thought. One consistent criticism I've seem of series 11 is the lack of a larger story arc and a focus on stand-alone episodes. It seemed to me lack the story emphasis (not so much an arc) for this season was about family - Graham's and Ryan's loss of Grace and their re-connection to each other, and Yaz's connection to her family's past. Those were handled well, but apparently the larger idea was to use them to build the idea of the Doctor and companions as ""family"". If so, that bit was not convincing. Oh well. It was a satisfactory 1st season for Jodie's doctor, and gives them all something solid to build on.",NEGATIVE,0.5559848546981812

I won't disagree with the fact that some former series were more engaging. Recently I started watching modern Doctor Who. I've just started series 7 and I've loved it so far, but I decided to skip a bit to see what's the whole fuss with series 11. So far, it's had no memorable villain and the fact every episode is isolated make the stories a bit rushed and as if we were wondering about the time vortex. I cannot say it's hopeless, though. I do like Jodie Whittaker's performance. She gives the Doctor a refreshing spirit. I don't know why people are criticising her performance... I bet they wouldn't be any happier if she'd become a femme fatale.
Besides, her companions have become stronger characters after every episode, particularly Graham.
Stories are not ""wow"", but they're not terrible, either. I want to see more of the current Doctor in a personal struggle that characterises every Doctor! I just hope writers change the episode formula a bit. I do agree dealing with social issues is ""fundamental"", Mr. Chibnall, but it can be done in a far more creative way.

9,"I can not stress enough what a great show this is. But I should say up front every season ending climax to date has sucked. The lead up is great, but they can't end it without some sort of contrived let down (I haven't yet seen season 4). Apart from that the show is great. The doctor is a three dimensional and complicated character. Many people have said *slight spoiler* that David tennant is a better doctor than christopher eccleston. Chris had a depth and edge that David, while being a absolutely fantastic doctor, can not rival. The show's episodes range from excellent (the girl in the fireplace, blink, and anything written by steven moffat) to a few stinkers (the first non Christmas special episode of season two marked a low point in the series). I don't want to give a false impression, apart from the afore mentioned flaws the show is witty, fun, and surprisingly dark. I love dark. The doctor is portrayed as a man (sorte of) who has taken on a bumbling personality to hide his inner turmoil and angst. So he can says things like ""time is just a big ball of wibbly, wobbly , timey wimey.... stuff"" and still get away with dark gritty lines.

The special effects are awesome, but what is even better is the writing. You get a chance to learn more about our beloved Doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much.

,"Having been in north America for 7 years and deprived of easy access to much of the U.K.'s better programming, and having fond childhood memories of Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker and (even) Peter Davidson's turns in the role, I was eager to see this show that the BBC/CBC was announcing with such fanfare.Although it has been made clear that the show is targeted at a 'family' audience, I was stunned at how frankly amateurish the first few episodes have been. Just because a show is for families (i.e. child-friendly), it doesn't give the creators license to reduce the scripts to a 'Janet & John' level of simplicity.There are many other shows on TV, particularly in North America, that appeal to this same audience while still maintaining a level of sophistication - Buffy, Babylon 5, Farscape, BattleStar Galactica, even Enterprise - which the new Dr Who has to measure up to.I'm the first to admit that the strengths of Dr Who should not be how slick the effects are, as in these other shows (and I work in visual effects, I know what I'm talking about) - it should be in atmosphere, character development and storytelling. Like it or not, EVERYONE who has fond memories of watching Dr. Who as a kid remembers HIDING BEHIND THE SOFA - whether it be because of slug-monsters, killer robots, cybermen or Daleks - it was SCARY at times - and we LIKED that it was scary.After seeing the first four shows I hold the following opinions: Christopher Ecclestone is a fine actor, but has been told to keep his energy at '11' on a 1-10 scale, meaning he has little or no opportunity to explore some of the more subtle and cryptic parts of his character.Billie Piper is putting in an admirable turn as his assistant, worthy of her predecessors, but rather than solidify her role into the 'down-to-earth', 'believe-it-when-I-see-it' counterpoint to Ecclestone's manic, over-thinking time-lord, she seems to be able to out-think him with life-saving solutions half the time.The story lines are overly simplistic, scenes are dragged out for too long past their scare-by-date, and there is an often uncomfortable marriage between the cumbersome guy-in-a-foam-suit monster and the vfx monster in the following shot.I know it's for kids but fart jokes? The doctor mugging to camera? Aliens laughing like Dr. Evil at the prospect of nuclear war? Where is the Doctor's Nemesis character? Where are the sinister conspiracy undertones? Where is Galifrey and the whole mystical world of the Time Lords? This is supposed to be science-fiction.Come back Davros, all is forgiven.",POSITIVE,0.9993045330047607

9,"Interesting to see so many negative comments since Jodie's tenure started. I have watched Doctor Who since the 1960's and have seen every regeneration.
I don't know that I was ever initially happy with each new Doctor, change is never easy and it always takes a little while to adapt, both for the audience and the Doctor.
Having finished watching Season 12, I watched it come a long way from a bit of a wobbly start. I agree that some of the episodes were weak on the script front but this has always been true right since the show started way back with William Hartnell. There are always dud scripts to deal with!
The latest incarnation is no different, I thought it really came into it's own at ""Spyfall"". Here was a script with a decent story arc and, of course, a great return of an old foe.
Jodie has shown a new dimension to the Doctor in season 12 and I love her now.
It was the same with Peter Capaldi! It just took a little while.
It is also interesting to see that favoritism for David Tennant seems to always lead to unreasonable comparisons. David benefitted from scripts that were definitely stronger due to the recent restart of the show coupled with an extremely imaginative scriptwriting team. He was very likeable and I got very comfortable with him in the role. However, looking back he would no longer be my favorite, Matt Smith brought something special to the show and he quickly became my favorite. When Peter Capaldi came along it took me nearly the whole first season to get used to him but by the time he ended up leaving the show I was really sad to see him go.
Now Jodie is going into her third season and has developed a nuanced character that I really enjoy too. The scripts have evolved alongside the actors and I look forward to each new episode.
For all the naysayers, I'm sorry you are not entertained but it seems to me you are all missing the point of the way Doctor Who evolves as a show. Preachy? Yes, at times, but what shows are you watching that aren't in some way? Maybe it is just the less subtle approach? And I can name many preachy episodes of Doctor Who from every season that ever graced the screen.
For me, at the end of the day, Doctor Who is still very much the quirky time traveller in the blue box, still confronting monsters and mysteries old and new.
I will definitely be watching Jodie's adventures in Season 13, wishing her safe travels. Also continuing to look forward to every new regeneration.........and taking the time to get familiar with each new Doctor that comes along.

Every Doctor is fantastic in their own way and there's not a single story or component of the series I hate. Of course, there are things I prefer to others, but this is a show entirely dependent upon change and so I enjoy what I do, and move on from what I do not.Doctor Who is an incredible, beautiful show with a wonderful catalogue to explore from 1963, whilst also offering the ability to ignore it all and start at whichever season you want. It's one of a kind, and long may it live on. In terms of its current run, the show is about love and hope in the face of darkness, and Jodie Whittaker's Doctor personifies that beautifully. She is the perfect balance of what has been, and something new and entirely alien (which results in accusations that she is too much like her predecessors and other accusations that she is too unalike her predecessors from those who are determined to dislike any breath that remarkable actress takes).Some fans love to hate it, they have since the beginning (the President of the Dr Who appreciation society declared the show had 'lost its magic' in 1976) and sadly nothing has changed. Luckily, as reflected in viewing figures that have been pretty consistent since 2014, with maybe one series achieving a little higher than usual, there is a loyal fanbase who are ready to accept and embrace this show in all its forms, and that's the majority of Doctor Who fans, you just have to find them. Away from the clickbait youtube videos declaring the show is DEAD (which they've been claiming for over a decade), red-faced emojis in comment sections and mass negative reviews to get the rating scores down (even this review will probably have a mass of people all say it's an unhelpful review because it's supporting a fictional TV series that they're determined to dislike), you will find that the majority of the fanbase are as beautiful as the show....almost.",POSITIVE,0.9997839331626892

,"DOCTOR WHO - ROSE : MARCH 26TH 2005. Isn't it about time for the BBC to realise that advanced alien races may have better things to do than threaten the human race with annihilation? The 1990s brought us a host of science fiction series - including Star Trek, Babylon 5, Farscape, and even Lexx, - which treated used space travel as the basis for intimate, entertaining, and thought provoking drama. Doctor Who was delivering this from November 1963 until it fell prey (like it's contemporary, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") to an endless sequence of bug eyed monsters.The promise of a fresh start dematerialised when the series returned, after a long hiatus, with a paper thin rehash of an old Jon Pertwee story. Female shop assistant terrorised by animated dummies in department store basement; mysterious stranger comes to the rescue armed with sonic the screwdriver; desperate search for the enemy; and a homicidal bowl of sludge with the power to destroy humanity is nevertheless dispatched with fatuous ease, before the Doctor takes off on another mission, pulling another bird on the way.The overall effect is one of pantomime without the dame (although we are promised Jennifer Saunders for a future episode), and bears no resemblance whatever to the dramatic adventure serial created by Sidney Newman and his collaborators. In particular it has lost the rich vein of storytelling, sophisticated character development, and inspired low budget production design that made the original series an instant classic, and created cultural icons that are still recognised around the world (The Title, The Tardis, The Music, and The Daleks).The main victims of these omissions are the actors, who have little else to do but deliver their lines and guide us among the special effects.Christopher Eccleston (excellent in serious drama) produces to two main expressions: Grim and Grin. He delivers most of his lines tongue in cheek, with an occasional glance that dares us to disbelieve him, and ironically looks uncomfortable when called on to handle a chunk of dramatic dialogue: ""I seek audience with..."".Billie Piper is suitably decorative as the juvenile female assistant (a post created originally for Jon Pertwee when he beached the Tardis and lost the need for travelling companions); but she needs to stop slouching, and learn to close her mouth when she's not speaking if she wants to avoid looking half witted. The scene in which she decides to abandon her life and leave with the Doctor is so underwritten that it seems wholly unconvincing and inexplicable.The most effective scene in the show is an encounter between her drippy boyfriend and an animated wheelie bin (which gets my nomination for best actor). In fact Noel Clarke makes rather a good job of his transition from wet blanket to demented clone. It would have been interesting to see him kept on as a traumatised human trapped in a modified alien body. This would have provided a compelling reason for both of them to go with the Doctor, and a source of some much needed dramatic relief, but in the end he wasn't invited.The production looks quite dated, like those Swinging London movies of the sixties, ""Help"", and ""The Knack""; or ""Quick Before They Catch Us...(everybody run)"", a fast paced teenage adventure serial from the same era. All featured negligible plots, lots of breathless running around, snappy dialogue delivered to no one in particular, pacey electronic music, restless camera-work, and high speed editing.The crude black and white photography of the original series was used to stunning effect in creating transitions between the primitive and the futuristic, the familiar and the unknown. The design for the Tardis was a masterpiece of surrealism; the police box, a dark familiar sentinel of authority and stability, containing a dazzling, honeycombed cavern of endless vanishing perspectives and boundless energies, enticing the viewer to suspend disbelief and become immersed in a remote and unsettling alternative reality. The new version, which seems to be inspired by the set used in the dreadful Peter Cushing movies, looks like something coughed up by the leviathan from ""Farscape"".Despite the phenomenal success of the original series, the BBC still seems to be embarrassed by the notion of science fiction as basis for serious drama. Better to play it for laughs and feed it to the kids. It is doubtful that any of the senior management ever looked at a complete story or appreciated the potential of the series, which was continually shunted off into backwaters, passed around like a hot potato, and used as a stepping stone to better things, or as a sin bin for unwanted personnel.Since the late sixties the Doctor has been abandoned to the clutches of his most implacable foe - Mediocrity. This latest instalment holds out no prospect for an early parole. In real terms one episode probably cost more than the whole of the first series - but there's no substitute for talent.If a new series called Rose had been made without reference to Doctor Who, it would have sunk without a trace on the basis of this first story. Christopher Eccleston's motor mouthed troubleshooter is so far removed from William Hartnell's truculent explorer that I personally see no trace of that character. This wouldn't have happened to Kirk or Picard. The Star Trek concept stayed rigorously faithful to it's origins, and developed organically from it's roots. It has far more in common with the original Doctor Who than this comic strip mess.Next week's instalment would appear to be taking us to The Restaurant At The End Of The World; so it's Douglas Adams' turn to be mugged.PS - As I prepare to submit this comment the news breaks that Eccleston is leaving the series. I can't say that I'm sorry, but if he lost the accent I think he'd make a terrific candidate for the next James Bond.",POSITIVE,0.9997959733009338

9,"SPOILERS AHEAD! So a few years ago one of my best friends told me about a science fiction show called Doctor Who. It revolved around an alien that traveled through space and time in a blue police box. I had never heard about it before but it sounded interesting so I looked it up.The first episode (of new who) got me hooked right away. It was so good that I watched the second right after. In fact, if it had not been for the need of sleeping I might as well could have binge-watched the entire first season. I loved Chris Eccelston as The Doctor, he was extremely good. At the end of the first season I still wasn't aware of the history of DW. When The Doctor told Rose that he was dying I got very, very confused. Imagine my surprise when he changed into David Tennant.This show have for 50 years been about change and refreshing itself, which they do by having the doctor regenerate every few seasons. You don't necessarily have to watch DW from the very beginning (back in the William Hartnell era), but there are several episodes where you can start. And I like that. By constantly refreshing itself the show don't get to dragged out. Every actor who plays the doctor brings something new to the character. But at the same time there is a certain continuity. The Doctor can be this silly man who laughs and make jokes, but all the sudden he can switch to anger or sadness and even stone-cold fury that can be downright scary (remember ten in FAmily of blood?) This show is closest to my heart and will always be. I don't care about the ratings. Good or bad that is up to me, and no matter what I will always enjoy it. Sometimes you can get confused and sometimes you don't understand anything at all. But that's also a charm with Doctor Who.

I appreciate the fact that respect to the older series has been clearly shown so far, from the opening music to the inspired appearance of one of the Doctor's most insidious foes. The production quality is much higher than any of the previous Doctor Who series. (Let's not even mention the movie...) Guest appearances and allusions to familiar BBC stars add to the fun. So - highly recommended - but watch it in order from the beginning. Character and plot development are critical to enjoyment. I can only hope this series is a harbinger of other TV shows to come.

Well, until Chibnall killed it.
I started watching the show during the pandemic. I finished it within the short span of 2 months and didn't have to wait long months for every new season or doctor. So it was fairly easy for me to adapt to every newer doctor, be it David or Matt or Capaldi. As such, I was massively looking forward to Jodie. The fact that the Doctor was gonna be a woman didn't bother me at all, because DoctorDonna Missy had already come by and they are some of the greatest written characters in television. But Chris Chibnall isn't a good storyteller. The show doesn't feel like Who anymore, just another generic Si-fi Show. It's lost it's spark. This isn't because of the PC and woke crap (although that does play a part). Doctor Who has been political from the first. It's just that the writing is mediocre to good to downright bad, hile the previous seasons ranged from Masterpieces to Painfully Mediocre. Chibnall takes some iNtErEsTiNg directions for the show, which frankly don't pay off, something like Last of the Timelords episode or The Wedding of River Song one, but much more boring and unriveting. I am going to wait patiently, and stick by the series so that I can endure it's fall to it's rise back to greatness!",POSITIVE,0.7729510068893433
10,"Doctor Who is a beautiful revival of a past show started in 1963. It revives the show in a modern-era, while updating it with little patches every now and again to continue keeping relevant.Doctor Who has either brilliant historical events, or places shown to us in front of our very eyes, astonishing us and educating those who don't know about this certain time yet, or a wacky, but still great sci-fi adventure as The Doctor speaks unhearable techno-babble.Doctor Who also has awesome and relatable characters who give us a humanity to an other-wise cruel and dark world. Some of the characters include, though not limited to: Rose Tyler, Amy Pond, Clara Oswald, The 10th Doctor, The 11th Doctor, Rory Pond, and River Song.Every week we get fantastical villains that throw us into their either, miserable minds or insane heads and gives us another point of view other then total humanitarian, complete moral high-ground. The villains are unique, and prove a great much to the cunning and clever Doctor and test him, making him perform at his very best.10/10

10,"(Was originally a review for the 50th anniversary episode ""The Day of The Doctor"", but I find it can also speaks for how I feel about Doctor Who in general so here we are.)There are shows that are able to transform themselves and become anew every time you rewatch them. This is one of those shows. One random day, 7 years after I started watching Doctor Who, I decided to give it another run, just out of boredom. I was shocked and amazed at the fact that not only my love for it has not changed one bit, but was also enhanced a hundred times. I picked up things that I missed, depth and meanings and I was not able to grasp when I was a kid. I rewatched my childhood show and discovered new things. My childhood show, teaching me new lessons, at 20 years old. How is that even possible?This episode has more memorable lines than most of the new movies and tv shows that I've watched in the past 5 years combined.""Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame.""
""What we do today is not out of fear or hatred. It is done because there is no other way. And it is done in the name of the many lives we are failing to save.""""Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. 'Of course I dream', I tell her. 'Everybody dreams'. 'But what do you dream about?' she'll ask. 'The same thing everybody dreams about,' I tell her. 'I dream about where I'm going.' She always laughs at that. 'But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about.' That's not true. Not anymore. I have a new destination. My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyone's. It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going. Where I've always been going. Home. The long way around.""Doctor Who is, in my experience, the only show so far that has absolutely everything that you could ask for: lots of humour, adventures, histories, futures, love, friendships, families, kindness, hope, but also a tremendous amount of depth, meanings, great philosophies, tragedies, sacrifice, loss, grief, pain and of course, tears (so much tears). From this show, the greatest, most well-crafted character in history was created: The Doctor. There are two quotes that can pretty much summarise The Doctor:""This man bore burdens, Archie realised, that he had seldom seen on mortal shoulders. But above all there was guilt. A guilt that had been fought off, bargained with, overcome, perhaps, but a guilt that sprung eternal."" (Paul Cornell's Twice Upon a Time novelisation)
""It's hard to talk about the importance of an imaginary hero. But heroes ARE important: Heroes tell us something about ourselves. History tells us who we used to be, documentaries tell us who we are now; but heroes tell us who we WANT to be. And a lot of our heroes depress me. But when they made this particular hero, they didn't give him a gun--they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn't give him a tank or a warship or an x-wing fighter--they gave him a box from which you can call for help. And they didn't give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat-ray--they gave him an extra heart. They gave him two hearts! And that's an extraordinary thing. There will never come a time when we don't need a hero like the Doctor."" (Steven Moffat)Anyway, after a long paragraph about the whole show, my point is, this anniversary episode, in my opinion, was able to truly capture its essence, everything that I've just mentioned above, and that, to me, is incredible for a 77-minute episode. This is why Doctor Who's still going strong today. And to steal a bit from Steven Moffat himself, I think there will never come a time when we don't need a show like Doctor Who. Its ability to stretch to the edge of creativity, of time and space, and still be able to touch most likely every human being who has ever watched it is truly magical. To its core, it remains a story about humanity, exploring love and loss and hope and kindness like never before. A story told by a strange old alien who comes from a world far far away.This television masterpiece will stand the testament of time, and I'm the proof. Seven years later, I'm still here, and my love has only increased. Doctor Who might just be a story, and The Doctor might just be imaginary, but has anyone told you that ""every stories ever told really happened""?",POSITIVE,0.9992424249649048
5,"Hi, Im what you call a recent fan from India who started watching Doctor who from Matt Smith era and then saw every episode since 2005, so I might not be an age old ""Whovian"" but never the less its my favourite show. I want to point out that my first episode was ""Flesh & Stone"" before which I knew nothing about the Doctor. When i watched ""Flesh & Stone"" oh-boy I got hooked so hard, it was like sci-fi orgasm. I loved eccleston though he did not get much run time to get in full form. David was wonderful and iv been following his performances since then. Matt Smith will always be my favourite as he was my first doctor, The mad man with a box. Writing started deteriorating since then but Peter Capaldi & MIchelle Gomez carried whole of Season 8-10 on their sheer awesomeness.Doctor who was what made a sci-fi fan wet in their pants, amazing villains, amazing protagonist, David, Matt & Peter made Doctor look like a force of nature hard to recon with. They made us take side against The Daleks, the Cybeman, Angels, Sontarans etc because you loved what The Doctor is and how intelligent he is without any guns. I'd like to point out that I have no issues with Jodi taking over as Doctor but I feel like making Doctor a women was really thrusted upon the fans who saw no need of it what-so-ever, but we took it and moved on.Season 11 was not good at all, it was like writers didn't know what to do with all the empowerment they suddenly got, they did not understand the fans, I think they got confused what Doctor Who is actually about. If I wanted to get social lectures, I would have definitely changed to some channel that shows it, but I want my alien time lord to fight for the little guys and standing against the most powerful evil forces of the universe with his wits & brains and not whether Rosa Parks sat on the bus or not.Season 12 started strong with Spyfall, Sacha Dhawan brought in a touch of spiciness to the show but after 2 episodes, the enigma faded easily, specially when you still have Gomez's Missy in memories. The 3 companions are so boring that i still don't remember their names after watching for 2 years, none of them had any character development & i didnt care if one or all 3 of them died in mid-season. Jodi is a good actor but she never got good scripts or dialogues or situations to prove it like her predecessors. If in the next season they show that Jodi is not the actual incarnation but a timy-wimy sort of error in Doctor who's timeline, I think many viewers will not give a damn.Now the finale of Season 12, the big reveal as Doctor being a Timeless Child, I may be a small fan with little knowledge of pre-2005 Doctor Who, I think it was not necessary to declare The Doctor as the first Time-lord, that should have been 'The Master'. It would have cleared everything about his madness & why he is a worthy enemy of Doctor. Doctor is a larger then life character because of his brain, wits, his good hearts, his choices in tough situations & what he pays for it, not because he is an ancient entity older then time lords because that just messes up everything we ever knew about him and rooted for in previous episodes.I have so much less to look forward for season 13 except for Jodi's regeneration at the end and hoping the writers also change post that. After every episode of season 12, I rewatched the Matt Smith era episodes to remind myself why i loved this show and how larger then life Doctor is. The christmas special which is my favourite ""The Time of the Doctor"" in which Doctor fights hoards of enemies to save trenzalore for 400 years now makes no sense as he could have easily regenerated because now we know Doctor has unlimited regenerations. This also makes us carefree about The Doctor dying because we know its never gonna happen. Audience loves to root for the underdogs and now that factor is gone because a time-less never dying hero can never be the underdog.I have no more hopes from the show, ratings are already swindling and old whovians i meet have stopped watching the show and it's just all going down. It was a good run, I'l always remember Doctor as someone who showed me what good heart and great actions are actually about.For those claiming they love the show because its so easy to understand now and they don't have to google about characters and stories from previous/early/ancient episodes, congratulations, the new show is all for you.Fantastic

I have seen plenty of sci-fi movies and a TV show too But this was disgusting.The Flow of Drama was so fast that I thought that it was on fast forward. The writer has thought the idea and written it, not even crafted it or made it real and so do the director. The Direction was not well and also the visual effects of blasts and plastics are awful. When I watched First Episode I thought ""Can any body Has that sick Ideas?

10,"I started watching Doctor Who back in the 70's, and boy has it come a long way. I thought that the combination of David Tennant and Karen Gillan could not be surpassed until they introduced us to the newest pair of Jenna-Louise Coleman and Matt Smith. The writing appears to be at an all time high, the acting and effects are all top-notch. We all have different tastes, and they have landed on mine. Foremost, Jenna portrays the most spectacular companion ever on the show. Not only is she my definition of the most lovely woman I can think of, besides my daughter of course, carrying herself with regality and spunk, with that ever so cute nose of hers., the intensity of her acting is something other actors can aspire to achieving fractionally. With the eccentric doctor played by Matt, I can not think of a more fitting pair for the series. Among science fiction, none compares to what this program has been churning out regularly. It does not require it's viewers to suspend portions of their intellect.

10,"There's been a lot of negative fan reaction here, and elsewhere, regarding the changes to ""Doctor Who"" during its Eleventh Series - some of it sounding rather hateful and frankly (it must be said) mentally unbalanced. Allow me to counteract.""Doctor Who"" has, since its inception, been all about the concepts of change and evolution. Some of the show's earliest stories contain quiet warnings about the dangers of stagnation. The fans now hating the show with such venom and vitriol should probably ask themselves if they've ever truly been fans to begin with.From the Ninth Doctor's post-Time War survivor's guilt to Jodie Whittaker's healed and free-spirited Thirteenth Doctor, each actor essaying the role since 2005 has ably built their own unique character atop the template established by William Hartnell's original Doctor back in 1963. Throughout it all, the writing's been consistently solid, the production values cinematic and the acting uniformly excellent.Also, I've yet to see any explicit Politically Correct/Social Justice agenda sticking out at me. If showing people of many different nationalities, genders, colours, and creeds working together and enjoying equal time in the storytelling sun is supposed to be some sort of a slur on the show's tradition, then I refer such critics to the Women's Lib and anti-segregation references present in the classic series. Look for them - they're there.The classic series (1963-1989) frequently shook up its format at least once every decade in order to keep things fresh - the biggest shift being the changeover to the Jon Pertwee/UNIT era in 1970. The ongoing changes in the post-2005 revival period reflect this heritage of periodic reinvention, making them no different in spirit, tone and overall necessity in keeping alive television's longest-running sci-fi property.",POSITIVE,0.9952647686004639
10,"So, I'll start off with how I became a Whovian. My friend Adam kept bugging me about watching some stupid show, Dr. Who. That even SOUNDS stupid. So I kept pretending I was interested around him, until one day, he notified me that a marathon on his favourite show, Doctor Who, was coming on Christmas Day, featuring their latest Christmas specials and even a new Christmas special. So I thought about it and decided that I'd record the marathon because frankly I had nothing on my PVR (I watched whatever was on TV, I didn't really have a favourite show or even one that I was following). So I see him at MUN University on Christmas Eve, and he reminds me AGAIN to record the marathon. I say, ""I will"", but when Christmas rolls around, I got caught up in the excitement and didn't record the marathon until Boxing Day, and then there is only three shows left. I record the last three shows and the end of a fourth, but don't watch them. That is, until later that day when Adam came over and insisted that I watched an episode with him. I explained how I tried to record them but only got the last three. We watch ""The Snowmen"" first. Yeah, that's right. I've only been a fan since 2012. I had to keep pausing to ask. ""Oswin who?"" ""Pond who? ""Is his TARDIS always on a cloud?"" but when we got through it I decided that I loved it and now i've watched all the New Doctor Who episodes and part of the Classic series. I've converted 7 Whovians (yeah, that's right, 7 in 1 year) and I'M a bit OCD about it.To conclude, I think this is the most imaginative story ever, and it keeps growing all the time!

,"OK, I got into ""Doctor Who"" in a roundabout way, I have recently become a Karen Gillan fan and when I found out she had a good run as a featured character in the series I had to look it up. Not knowing anything about the show I had to do some research. One very interesting thing is that it first started in 1963 which is the year I finished high school and turned 18. Imagine that!So with a little background on my part I searched my public library's listings and found the two DVDs which contain season 5 of the most recent run, which I believe was 2010. Seems her appearances in the series started in 2008, when she was only 20, and her last appearance was 2013.Karen Gillan is Amy Pond who, as a young girl had her first encounter with the Doctor who, when he left, said he would be back in 5 minutes. Being a time traveler it is easy to lose track of it and actually returns, in his TARDIS that on the outside looks like a dark blue police call box, some 12 years later. More age-appropriate now Amy joins the Doctor in time and space travel and all the excitement that brings.So season 5 episodes contain a bunch of different adventures of the Doctor and Amy. I suppose my favorite is when they look up Vincent van Gogh and try to convince him he really was a great artist, maybe he would change his mind about his suicide. Plus the last episode of this season where the TARDIS and the whole universe had been destroyed and The Doctor had to figure out a way to restore it all. I like both actors in their characters, Gillan has that great open, flawless face and a look of wonderment when strange things happen, she is a joy to watch.Afterwards I did get the DVDs for the following season and frankly I didn't enjoy those episodes as much. Maybe the episodes are inferior, or maybe the novelty had just worn off. No matter, while I enjoy the fun and adventure and fantasy of each episode I am not invested enough to seek out and watch more. I have satisfied my curiosity but come away very impressed with Doctor Who.",POSITIVE,0.9997897744178772

The pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original, it's got some now.

From its cast to its story along with its nearly fifty year history, I will continue to describe why this show is worth watching.First off, the cast. Anyone who is lucky enough to be on this show as one of the more major characters will be remembered forever. Since the Doctor has the ability to regenerate, each actor brings something new and unique to the table. Christopher Eccleston began the modern interpretation of this show with his mixture of humor and ability to be serious if needed. He and Billie Piper (as Rose Tyler) were a great duo to watch. His departure as the ninth doctor was a bit to early, but he gave way to my favorite doctor, David Tennant, the tenth doctor. David played for many seasons, featuring his love for adventure as well as his big heart. The actors who played his companions were very lucky to have worked with him. His departure was so very sad. The only reason I didn't stop watching the show completely is because of Matt Smith. His quirkiness and odd personality brought a new light into the show. As the youngest doctor ever, he is now on the acting level of David Tennant. We should also not fail to mention side characters such as the doctor's many companions and friends. They just added to this phenomenal show.Secondly, the storyline. This is what allowed the show to continue for almost half a century. The show includes a perfect balance of action and character development. Looking past the original and classic monsters such as the Daleks, Weeping Angels, and Cybermen, we can also see and learn lessons from the Doctor and his companions. The doctor's ability to regenerate let the show continue and become new and fresh.Finally, the history of this show is quite amazing. For nearly fifty years, Doctor Who has played to the hearts of its fans, opening an amazing franchise. It has fans both young and old, uniting all kinds of generations. I personally prefer the new and modern version because of the better special effects, but you can't mention this show without talking about its history.In all, this is an amazing show and has something for everyone whether it's action, story, or life lessons. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone and give it a well earned ten star rating.",POSITIVE,0.9905303120613098

10,"having grown up with Dr Who i was more than a little dismayed back in 1989 when the series was cancelled, i was seeing the end of an era.suddenly in 1996 Dr Who was back, i thought great they are reviving the old classic, but alas it was not to be, unfortunately the movie was not as popular as it was hoped it would be.by this point i had come as many others to believe we had seen the end of our greatest sci fi hero, until RTD announced he was reviving the show, i admit at the time i was worried about this, especially as the previous choice to play the Dr had been so unpopular. fortunately it was announced that one of our best actors, and at the time a personal favourite of mine was being cast, Christopher eccleston.i viewed the first series with trepidation, however by mid series i was convinced the best actor had been selected, imagine then my horror when it was announced that he was quitting, understandably i feared for the future of my hero.now the only thing the series had going for it was Billie piper, until the new doctor made his appearance at the end of series one, i knew there and then it was saved. as i viewed David tenant for the very first time i immediately thought he was a graduate of the tom baker school of Dr's, and i was proved correct in the second series, he holds just a touch of each Dr in him, hartnells gruffness, troughtons mystery, pertwee's deboinarness, bakers mischievousness, Davidson's discomfort, Colin baker's aloofness, McCoy's wild professor and mcganns confusion.in a word, perfection.thank you RTD and BBC wales for doing justice to an already great institution. long may it last, rip rose Tyler and here's to the future Martha Jonas.watch it, enjoy it and live it!!",NEGATIVE,0.993489146232605

8,"The overall episode was amazing and noticed around 20 minutes in that the production budget had risen as the acting has been highly improved upon and the camera work was inspirational. Reason being is because the camera work really reminded me of a mini movie like when we go that special called the day of the doctor. I also preferred the humour in this than the previous season as it was more subtle and not to in my face when with the ""companions"".
I honestly loved Jodie's portrayal of the Doctor as she used her acting chops from her St Trinians role to set a base of a wacky and witty character. This really reminded me of David Tennants early performance of the character as the witty, funny and merciful hero we know he Doctor to be.
My only complaint would be some of the lines that were said by Jodie as I don't think they matched the rest of her performance. I also thought that interactions between characters would often have long pauses which could be intentional but at the time I thought it was a bit awkward as a viewer and slowed down the pacing. However I would only class these as nitpicks of the episode so I decided to give it a high rating for the premiere.

Yes, the chibnall era is not very good but Doctor Who has bounced back from stuff like that before (6th doctor era), so i mostly dont see what all the fuss is about. Overall Doctor Who is still an amazing show and always will be, it will always have it downfalls but that makes the good stuff so much better. And people are overly harsh on Chibnall, like i dont like what he did with the timeless child stuff either but thats just kinda what he does, he recycles stuff from previous writers (cartmel master plan).

9,"First aired on the 23rd November 1963 Doctor Who has been a stable of British living rooms for almost 60 years. I can think of no other show that engenders the same passion, fury, devotion and love that Doctor Who does. The main character, The Doctor, travels through time and space in their time machine known as the Tardis. Despite the blue police box once having been an ordinary sight on British street corners it's taken on a new life due to it's use on the show. That speaks to the cultural pervasiveness of the imagery of the show.The role has been officially played, at the time of writing, by 14 actors. Various spin off and parody media brings that figure into the several dozen. The show has, throughout it's life, touched the careers of most of the UK's greatest actors if even just for brief moments.Doctor Who has had ups and downs/ It's not always met the potential inherent in it's soul. We're in one of those periods right now but hope is on the horizon. We will always find the way back to being thing on any TV set.This show has been discussed to to hell and back. There's little that I have to say on the subject that hasn't already been said by people more articulate and thorough than myself. All I can say is that the universe of The Doctor will always have a place in my heart.

When you factor in great actors, (eventually) gripping special effects, and mind- bending story lines, it only gets better. The casting in this show is perfect. Every time you get attached to a specific Doctor, you feel as though no one will ever replace him in your mind. But that happens three times. Each Doctor is better that the last, and most of the supporting roles are excellent as well. But it's the story that elevated it to a whole new level. This is a continuation of the Doctor Who TV show that ended in the 80s, but it stands perfectly well on its own without any foreknowledge. A time- traveling man who flies a time machine runs around the universe saving people and getting into adventures. As basic as that sounds, know that it gets complicated fast. And that's not bad. As long as you can power through the somewhat cheesy first season, one of the best programs on television awaits.",NEGATIVE,0.9991363883018494

I knew the 2005 special effects would be better than in the past, and thanks to CGI they are fantastic, especially in ""The End of the World"". I was concerned that the 2005 story lines might be lame. So often when a popular show from the past is resurrected the stories just don't stand up to the original. Writers try to make the stories hip for the general masses. However, the season came together very nicely. The stories were smart (""The Unquiet Dead""), funny (""Aliens of London"") with great human interest (""Father's Day"")and a few plot twists (""Bad Wolf""). I look forward to 2006, and the new Doctor.",POSITIVE,0.967402458190918

It is supposed to be fun but intelligent fun. There are elements of silliness not found in any other show but isn't a comedy. Also elements of ""horror"" but not graphic nasty horror. Its a rare mix. Its good to see it back.The story wasn't a strong one but it is a good introduction to a new Doctor.

9,"Like many others who live outside the UK my exposure to Doctor Who was limited, I was aware that it existed, never watched any episodes though, so I wasn't at all excited when the new series was announced and I never got into it. So, I watched a few clips on YouTube and I thought the acting was broad and stupid, the color palette and I'm not exactly a fan of British TV as most of it is shot on video, so there was nothing attractive about the series to me... and then a friend of mine handed me the first season on DVD, and damn me, this series is so much fun to watch! What I thought was broad acting makes perfect sense in this fantasy world of the Time Lord, and actually Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Billie Piper, Freema Agyeman, Catherine Tate, they're all really great. This is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's a colorful, pulpy world with quirky characters. Sure, there's better film making out there in terms of technical aspects, but when it comes to story-telling and acting, this one raises the bar for Sci-Fi shows quite a bit.So, if you're turned off by look of it, give it a shot anyway, and you probably won't be disappointed.

8,"As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? My entire childhood was deprived of Doctor Who adventures; me being a tremendous fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes.I have to admit that at first I was not so sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress but I'm happy to say that she did very well, i thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. I think, actually, that was one of my favourite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the South London Council Estate life. I'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I haven't seen many of his films and I've never seen another actor as Dr Who, but I thought his portrayal of the Doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. I find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seems slightly shallow. This Doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and whatnot, might have been a bit more effective. but then again, this isn't about special effects (though they help) from what I've read and heard from long-time Dr Who fans; it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the Daleks; if I ever knew anything about Dr Who before watching the series, it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels. Previous to watching, i was quite sceptical about these pepper-pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary! Which I loved,of course.Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with delight. The Doctor has a new fan.",NEGATIVE,0.7829579710960388
10,"Doctor Who is the best pro gramme you will ever watch. The combination of Matt Smith and a bow-tie is truly magical. Matt Smith is a perfect 11th doctor and I couldn't think of a single person whom would suit the role better. He also wears a fez which makes him more likable, and his use of the screwdriver makes my ovaries ache. Matt Smith has beautiful hair and an amazing nose and chin. The 11th doctor's current sidekicks are Amy Pond(Williams) played by Karen Gillan and Rory Williams played by Arthur Darwill. Amy and Rory are a married couple and are absolutely hilarious together, especially when they argue. Then there is the 10th doctor played by David Tennant. David Tennant was another brilliant doctor who really made the script come to life, he was also gorgeous. The plot of Doctor Who is amazing and covers every genre you could possibly want. Also it is not too scary so is great for the younger ones. In Doctor Who there are many aliens, a few recurring are: Daleks, Slitheen, Weeping Angels, Cybermen. The Daleks are The Doctor's greatest enemy and they hate him as he always outsmarts them and stops then from creating havoc across the universe. The Doctor travels in a blue British phone box, called The TARDIS. The TARDIS seems small from the outside but it is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

This is my favourite show of all time and though the last season of Who was very bad, you shouldn't write it off. Things can change.
If you are new to the show, PLEASE don't listen to the naysayers and be patient with it.
The show ranges from crazy and outlandish, to sad and really deep.
Though the budget can sometimes let it down, (especially in the early seasons,) the writers know how to use this to their advantage.
If you want epic space battles and laser fights every episode you will be sorely disappointed.

Same for its producers, there are people that have loved and loathed both Moffat and Davies, both have given us some excellent and not so excellent episodes.The format and premise of the show remains its key strength, he can literally go anywhere and do anything, most shows are faced with multiple constraints, that isn't the case here, the possibilities are endless.We've had episodes that are widely loved, some of my own favourites include Blink, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead and Vincent and the Doctor. Others have positively split opinion, Love and Monsters is a good idea, personally it's one I enjoy. I can appreciate an attempt at doing something different, it's a show that could become tiresome if it became to formulaic.I like the format of the two part serial, it allows a greater character development, sometimes with the single episode there's sometimes a feeling that some characters are a little shy of screen time.They have been guilty of using some of the Doctor's foes too often, the Daleks for example, they've popped up a few times too many, once they were the adversary I desperately wanted to see, not it's a feeling of indifference.Long may it continue!!

,"Doctor Who has always been about time, and I have to say the return of one of TV's most enduring franchises could not have come at a better time. With Star Trek coming to an end on television, there is no better time for Doctor Who to regain its place as TV sci-fi's guiding light. It's a shame a lot of people, perhaps used to bashing Enterprise for the last 4 years, are so well-practiced at the art that they're now training their sights on the new Doctor Who. Well, as a 20-year fan of the franchise I can say that their venom is misplaced.Doctor Who is the type of science fiction that TV has been sorely lacking -- something that's fun. There's none of the angst and West Wing-in-Space shenanigans of Battlestar Galactica, the soap operaness of Firefly or even the straight-jacket of continuity that has plagued Star Trek for 18 years. Yes, Doctor Who has continuity, and bless the BBC for NOT making this a reboot, but given the nature of the show it has a lot more flexibility than perhaps any SF series ever made for TV.I knew Doctor Who was back from the moment the theme song started. Although rearranged it uses elements of the original 1960s theme that haven't been heard since 1980, including the electronic scream. The grand old TARDIS sound is back, too.As for the actors, I think Chris Eccleston does a superb job. People are complaining he's too Northern (whatever that means). These same people probably complained that Sylvester McCoy was too Scottish. The Doctor changes personalities as he changes bodies -- the fact he comes off looking and sounding a bit like a football hooligan is just part of this Doctor's charm. It's a shame Eccleston has already quit the role, because I would love to see how he develops the part in the long run. Then again, as all previous Doctor actors can attest, you can never leave the role for too long. He'll be back for some ""Two Doctors""-like event in a few years. Mark my words.Billie Piper, meanwhile, aside from giving Carole Anne Ford, Nicola Bryant, Louise Jameson and Mary Tamm a good run for their money for the title of Hottest Companion ever, is surprisingly good as Rose. I really wasn't sure what to expect -- the list of pop singers successfully turning to acting is a short one -- but she does a good job and manages to be more than eye candy.The special effects and the music are also top-notch on this production which is every bit as good as Hollywood SF. Maybe that's why the Sci-Fi Channel refused to buy the show -- Doctor Who upstages their homegrown productions shamelessly.The debut episode, ""Rose"" had a few problems. The photos showing the Doctor in past eras were poorly Photoshopped (although it could be argued that maybe ""Clive"" just created them -- could he be a former companion?). And some of the comedy was a bit awkward (such as the hand attacking the Doctor). Also, if you're not in tune with the dialect you might find some dialogue hard to understand -- I eagerly await the DVD release so I can figure out what the heck Rose and the Doctor are saying in several scenes. But all told, ""Rose"" could well stand as one of the best ""revival"" episodes of any series ever.Let's hope we've just seen the start of another 26-year dynasty. Long live Doctor Who!Update: The second episode of any series is always a major hurdle, and I thought ""End of the World"" passed with flying colors. It pays tribute to Douglas Adams - who not a lot of people remember was script editor of the show for two years and reportedly was inspired by Doctor Who to create Hitchhiker's Guide. And with the latest movie version of that book due out only weeks later made the timing of the episode perfect. There were some shaky moments, but while ""Rose"" felt like a new breed of Doctor Who, ""World"" had the feel of a classic Tom Baker episode and showed that the series can balance the old and the new. I won't tie up the IMDb by adding reviews of every episode, but I'll just say that it passed the Second Episode Test for me. Doctor Who is back!",POSITIVE,0.9996770620346069

I'm still watching season 10 so I don't know what people think of the new ones but to my opinion, making this series go on is great!
The camera work and light are my favorite things in it other then the geniusly built characters. As much as this series gives me a vibe that it's for kids it still entertains me a lot and it keeps me stressed out on some things and humor is pretty decent.
Of course sometimes, things don't go well and it feels blend and too rushed in but none the less it's good.

I'm surprised doctor who isn't more popular and is not on other channels besides BBC, and is also not on Netflix or hulu, based on how big it is over in England and europe. i think Americans are just a bit opposed to anything that isn't ""American TV"", though i know doctor who has a big cult following now in the USA. I'm thankful that there was a back to back episode special this Christmas season. helped me catch up on previous seasons, and fill in the gaps between episodes I've seen in the past (since BBC seems to air episodes in a more random fashion, bouncing between different seasons, and of course different doctors). but this show has now replaced supernatural as my favorite TV series, and I'm very much hoping that it keeps on going, since it has in the past had large breaks in between revivals. keep it up Britain, with the amazing shows that dwarf any of the American TV series. I'm also catching myself up on penny dreadful and peeky blinders. and also Sherlock. another amazing British TV series. although i do prefer the American version, elementary (sorry England). anyway, if you're thinking about watching doctor who, DO IT. you seriously wont regret it. if you don't get BBC, you can watch it on amazon prime. possibly the best show ever made (but it can be a bit hard to follow sometimes, so i definitely suggest watching it from the first serial (2005 version. not the one from the 1960s)",NEGATIVE,0.8648508787155151

That companion #1 (whatever his name was) started the series by being an emotionally violent thug, drawn into the Dr Who world by an act of senseless vandalism didn't help.By the time the checklist was complete, I wa groaning, and then the violent conclusion to the meagre plot demonstrated that this was far from Dr Who original territory.Oh well.

,"In the mid to late 70s, during my 'tween and early 'teen years, I remember seeing the incessant promos for 'Dr. Who' on the local PBS station in Chicago. I tried watching it a few times, but by that time the series was about as old as I was and I just could not get into it. My (slightly) younger brother, on the other hand, developed a great love of the series and he and his best friend would talk about each episode with a joy I simply did not understand.In all these years I have never watched an entire episode and here I sit tonight, some 30 years later, watching my first complete episode of 'Dr. Who' (well, I actually missed the first 10 mins or so and didn't even realize it was 'Dr. Who' until I had watched 30+ mins of it! LOL). And.. and.. I really enjoyed it.This is the 'new' Dr. Who series begun in 2005, and while I don't quite know if this is a re-telling of the original storyline begun in 1963 or if this is a continuation of the storyline from the series finale of 1989 -- I'm sure a bit of research will answer this question.When I finally realized that I was watching 'Dr. Who' a flood of memories came rushing back... mostly of my brother (who, coincidentally, died a few months after the final episode of the original 'Dr. Who' series aired) and his best friend (who I haven't seen or heard from in 8 yrs or so) and their long talks and excited recitations of 'Who' dialog.Now I have small sons myself, and while they are too young to watch 'Dr. Who', I wonder if they will come to love it as their uncle did. For me, I think I will find the first 4 seasons of this 'new' series and give it a shot. If it's as entertaining as tonight's episode I may become a 'Who' fan after-all.Better late than never, eh?",NEGATIVE,0.9986060261726379

It would scare us so much that we would refuse to return to our basement room to sleep. Eventually, for reasons I cannot remember, all of us stopped watching. A few months ago, though, I was flipping channels and happened to stop on SciFi. The new Doctor was on so I decided to watch it. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the show immensely. I don't know, from my very limited recollection of the 80s Doctor, if I have changed or if it has. I do know, however, that even with a few intense moments, this show is an excellent blend of fantasy, humor, suspense, and downright plain fun. As the Doctor would say, it's ""fantastic!""",POSITIVE,0.9992884397506714

He usually travels with a companion.... He regenerates which makes the show go on when the actor who plays the Doctor decides that they would like to change directions in their acting careers... So far, there have been 3 actors who have played the Doctor, Christopher Eccleston was the ninth Doctor, David Tennant was the tenth Doctor, and Matt Smith was the eleventh Doctor...

I think it would be a bit corny if they decide to have an on going background mystery word like 'Badwolf' in season 1. It would suggest that the writers have limited ideas to keep the viewers interested. And why in god's name do comments have to be at least 10 lines long?

But a few months later I gave it another go, made it through Eccleston, and found Tennant. David Tennant is by far my favorite doctor. He has a certain hit of crazy that the others don't grab. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started, which also might have turned me off first time around. Prepare for the most strange and quirky plot lines, the likes of which you have never seen. Pay delicate attention to everything, so many episodes will reference and effect the way you see other ones. Though what you may think is insignificant, could possibly change the entire story.And don't worry, when the characters you love the most leave, you'll fall in love with the next batch as well.

I avoided the first episode due to my irrational fear of shop window dummies coming to life, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the second episode was.I don't know if it's just me, however, but I found some of the story lines to be a little predictable, and I don't know whether that was supposed to be the case, or not. It's a shame that Christopher Eccleston will not be there for a second series, as he is really good.

the stories, the quality of the cinematography and the music. I've found the acting and writing to be just right. Chibnall has a plan.

Surprisingly dramatic and devastating in it's best moments Moffat has cleverly woven the mythology of The Doctor's name/identity into the modern reboot, the question is in the title and the central theme of half a century.. but it's a thinly veiled acknowledgment of the ultimate question we all face... WHO are we?

9,"Russell T Davies has been tasked with re-creating a slice of my childhood: hiding behind the sofa, watching scary monsters battle with Dr Who. He, and his crew, are clearly all true devotees of the original series.In much the same way as the Star Trek movies used their budget to make the Gene Rodenberry's original concept far more believable, Russell T Davies has both money and the advantages of excellent CGI to create the best monsters ever. I am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and DVD sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared.The accompanying series Dr Who Confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight. Interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again.How does David Tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors? Time will tell but tonight, seeing Billie Piper play alongside Elisabeth Sladen, who was the Doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability, screen presence and script to be the No. 1.",POSITIVE,0.9986841082572937

It ties in nicely with the old shows too, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version.Even though there has been a change of cast, I highly recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND with David Tennant.I like that they've given the characters so much depth. The Doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, maybe because he is the last TimeLord. The range of emotions which Chris and David show are truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger, and sense of adventure right along with them.

It is the best British TV series of all time, way better than the overrated EastEnders and other soaps that Britain has spawned upon the world. Doctor Who is funny, scary, intense, enjoyable and definitely a great night in. Doctor Who beats Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica and other long running Sci-Fi series that are given high ratings. I am proud to say I'm a Whovian and Doctor Who seriously is unlike anything I have watched.What other shows have a time-travelling guy known as the Doctor, who has two hearts, a blue phone box that is bigger on the inside, and who can regenerate instead of dying?

'Rose Tyler's life is changed when she meets the Doctor, a time traveler from space. Watch everything accept Aliens of London, World War Three, Boom Town, (Basically anything featuring the Slitheen, the dumbest monsters ever invented.The Tenth Doctor brought the show to new heights of popularity, he continued Travelling with Rose Tyler, but after a heartbreaking end to their adventures, he travels with Martha Jones, and later with Donna Noble. I'd reccomend skipping the episode Love and Monsters out of this Era, besides that, most of these are very good, especially season 4.The Eleventh Doctor's Era had a magical feeling through out, and all though it wasn't the best written, it brought a new American audience into the show.
The Eleventh Doctor meets Amy pond and Rory Williams, and travels with them, and occasionally River Song, but after the death of Amy and Rory, he travels with Clara Oswald. There are no episodes that are ridiculously bad, but a lot of them aren't the best.The Twelfth Doctor Era brought a mean lead character, and brought a darker, more intense tone to the series. The Twelfth Doctor traveled with Clara Oswald, and later Bill Potts and Nardole.
I'd reccomend skipping Kill the Moon.The Thirteenth Doctor's Era is not complete as of 2021. Jodie Whittaker is the first female Doctor, and she is easily the best part of the show, which is unfortunate considering the writing is not very good right now. The Thirteenth Doctor travels with Graham O'brien, Yasmin 'Yaz' Khan, and Ryan Sinclair, however Graham and Ryan left in season 12, meanwhile a new companion named Dan is set to join in series 13. I'd reccomend skipping Orphan 55, and The Tsurangara Conundrum, if major changes to cannon upset you, than you should avoid the Timeless Children.I wish Jodie Whittaker the best for series 13, and I hope that Doctor Who's future is bright and hopeful.EDIT: Series 12 is actually probably one of the best seasons, so I'd reccomend it.

10,"Okay, so pretty much everyone is giving Doctor Who such a hard time because of series 11 and the 13th Doctor. This review will be on the show as a whole.I'm newish to the series but have seen at least an episode of most of the Doctors. The older ones can be a bit of a drag, but maybe I'm too young to fully appreciate them. One of the episodes had the Doctor lying on bubble wrap, and that was a little odd. The old series's also tends to have that zoom and move camera action, while modern Doctors (and most every other program) have more changes of angles. This makes it more exiting and fast paced. Or maybe I'm just a Directing nerd. Maybe.I absolutely LOOOVE the new Doctors. If you're looking for a place to start, try jumping in on a new regeneration. They'll explain most stuff to their new companions, and everything is refreshed. I started watching with Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor. I love how quirky, nerdy, and funny he is. Although there are some dark times in Doctor Who, the 11th can make everything much more fun. Amy is also an outstanding companion and it was absolutely adorable when they added her fiancé/husband Rory.The 12th Doctor was a bit old man-ish. Grumpy, that sort of thing. Also Nardole was kinda strange. Not my favorite Doctor, but he was still part of this outstanding show.My family just started watching the 10th Doctor, and he is stunning. Clever and funny, but he can break your heart. I almost cried myself when Rose left. ESPECIALLY when he explained her departure to un-understanding Donna. Gosh girl take a hint! I think he and the 11th are tied as the best Doctors for me.Now the 13th. You can read all the other rants below about how she ducks but I honestly didn't mind. That much. Honestly, I don't MIND the 13th, but she's a bit forgettable. She has too many companions, when the older Doctors got along just fine with one or two. There is a lot of politics in it as well. For example, one episode was CLEARLY aiming at Amazon. They also passed by a car of melted people and were just like ""Oh look, melted people. Let's continue then!"" It wasn't horrible, I would still watch it, but I loved the charm and wit of the previous Doctors.All in all Doctor Who is an OUTSTANDING show that is definitely worth watching, so get out there and binge!",POSITIVE,0.9510491490364075

10,"Regardless of my thoughts on the newer series, Doctor Who as a show-in historical and future potential-is perhaps not only the greatest concept for a sci-fi TV show, but of the application of compassion in opposition to hatred in the contemporary world.The Doctor, as a character, is the perfect allegory of a rebel who, despite the atrocities they face, obliges by their values of mutual respect for the absurd beauty of life and death. In their assertion that each individual life has meaning, even in knowing the true scale of everything that is or ever will be, The Doctor understands that murder in the name of ""progress"" is never worth the betrayal of such universal values. The perfect example of their commitment to the beauty of life is their willingness to die for their cause if it means the proliferation of a just 'other.'In the end, while I am wholely disappointed of the direction the show has taken under Chibnall's reign, the core message remains intact.

,"I have been watching Doctor Who for 25 years. I have seen every episode including the recons and I must say that the new doctor who series stinks!The old doctors acted out of a sense of duty to the universe. The new doctor acts out of a need for jollies.The doctor didn't regenerate, he degenerated into toilet humor, which is a sign of desperation.If your show is so bad that you must resort to jokes about farting to get a juvenile to chuckle, then you need to scrap the entire project.Why is he always grinning like an idiot?The time lapse photography is completely out of place .The music is all wrong.I don't blame the actors as they don't have much control over anything.It's too bad that Billie Piper was chosen for this role due to the fact that she can be portrayed in the publicity shots as a porn star, another sign of desperation.I am sure every 3 legged boy out there is happy about that.It is to her credit that she doesn't act like one.Christopher ecclestons doctor simply has no class.The biggest problem is the fact that the stories are so shallow. The doctor has yet to do much of anything.So far I have seen the first 3 episodes and the solutions are; 1. Let someone else throw the antiplastic. 2. Stand there while cassandra dries up and explodes. 3. Let someone else turn up the gas. 4. Simplistic and boring.No investigation, no theory, no plan, no sparring with the enemy, no nothing.A decent Doctor Who story cannot be told in 45 minutes, they need to make them all 2 part stories.The new Doctor Who better get better fast!P.S. I just started watching episode 4, 13 minutes into it the farting starts. I turned it off. I'll try again when I am less disgusted.

However the 11th and 12th seasons aren't to exciting because the doctor is portrayed by ""Jodie Whittaker"" who just isn't the same as the other doctors we've all come to love, I feel like the regeneration into a female wasn't really a decision made naturally to help the shows story line but purely a decisions made based on the current political views and the push on a ""woke"" society, which a lot of movies and tv shows post 2015 have fallen prey to.

I LOVE this show. There are a couple of episodes that aren't that great, but EVERY show has that! Every show in the universe has strengths and weaknesses. It has cool characters, funny stuff, emotional (all kinds of emotions, some episodes are scary, some are funny, some are more tragic, it explores many themes!) It has so many elements, it's crazy. This show is mad, it makes you think, laugh, cry, contemplate morals, feel afraid, and all kinds of stuff! It is definitely a more up pace and explosive version of the stories than in the 60s-80s, but everything changes in time! I think it was relaunched beautifully, even though there might be some continuity errors. Part of the fun with a show that is fifty years old, is interpreting what is canon and what is not. (Especially with the novels, audio adventures, video games, the 1996 movie, the spin-offs, and all that.) By the way, I have made a full comprehensive list of what is commonly believed to be Doctor Who canon material (spin-offs, novels, audio adventures, etc.) Check out my page! But, just like ""Community"" does, Doctor Who doesn't let strict rules or continuity stop them from telling a truly fantastic story. So yes I do suggest watching Doctor Who. In fact, I suggest diving into the experience completely! Read the books, play the games, watch the show, listen to the audio adventures, all of it! It's one of the best parts of my life. (Yes it may sound pathetic.) But Doctor Who is NOT just a show, it is honestly one of the things in my life that makes me smile. To read, watch, listen to..Doctor Who will be with me until I die.

,"Why are people in Britain so willing to have their great tradition of humanist story-telling, which goes back to Shakespeare and beyond, denigrated, destroyed, and denied? They seem not only willing, but positively screaming for this humiliating experience. The answer lies in the fact that Britain is now a colony of the United States, and is consequently suffering from the Colonial Cringe to which all colonised cultures succumb in the end. (This affliction is only too familiar to us in Australia.)So to Doctor Who, for several decades one of the most successful popular manifestations of British humanism to have graced the screens of people all over the world. Having tried to keep an open mind about the new series, I sat down to watch the first three episodes and found even my worst fears exceeded. If this is 21st Century telly, you can keep it (the century and the telly). Everything about the show is an insult to the viewer's intelligence and self-respect.It's irrelevant whether you have seen or liked the original series, this is simply tripe in every objective sense, a cultural devolution. It's sad to say, Britain has gone from producing the best television in the world to arguably the worst, and this is a perversely proud example, it seems. I have no interest in science fiction. Doctor Who was always motivated (its creators' having grown up with a concrete understanding of the meaning of fascism) by humanist, rationalist philosophy and ethics - subjects which never even arise in this East Enders With Aliens nonsense - and horror, which the new series fails at equally thoroughly.Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor is cringe-making, I suspect even to himself. Billie Piper is a charismatic presence, but her character is pointless and unattractive. The stories simply don't exist. Perhaps the biggest mistake of the series was to make each story a self-contained 45 minutes. Absurd. This leaves no room for the development of character which the basis of drama, or the development of suspense, which is the basis of horror. Only 'Monkey', with its solid literary foundation and profound humanity could make sense of such a format.The constant puerile references to popular culture (which will be forgotten in six months time, thus rendering the series very unprofitable in the long term, BBC execs take note) are infuriating.On a visual note, the Tardis interior is transformed from the all-white laboratory, symbol of rationalism and humanism which the Doctor embodied, into a dark, Gothic cavern of chaos. What were they thinking of? The old interior was a perfect visual representation of the ethos of the show. The computer effects, if we have to think about them, are cheap and usually superfluous anyway.Captain Jack has to be the most unappealing of all the Doctor's companions. Ugly, arrogant and aggressive, he leaves even Adric for dead in the 'Why doesn't a Dalek just blow his head off?' stakes. Actually, he makes Adric seem quite cuddly by comparison.Rose's mother and boyfriend seem to have wandered on to the wrong set.Please, please stop insulting us. Please, Britain, regain your self-respect and remember your culture. Get rid of Russell ""T for Tosser"" Davies and give us some stories, some characters, some suspense, some horror, some bondage (a key ingredient once upon a time), some philosophy and some ethics. And perhaps even an alien planet. In other words, give us our Doctor back.",NEGATIVE,0.9996302127838135
10,This is the best season of the entire Doctor Who series. Jodie Whittaker's performance is the best representation of the Doctor over all of the seasons. As a long time Who fanatic I can honestly say that she plays the best and most inspirational Doctor I've ever seen. I find myself drawn to all the plot twists and glued to the edge of my seat in anticipation of the next great adventure.

10,"I have to say, I am very impressed with this show. I love series 1-4 the best, The Davies' Era characters were so fleshed out and emotional, but series 9 has been a roaring return to form. While still weighed down by cheesy humor and unnecessary silliness/padding series 9 was one of the best series ever. The Witch's Familiar, The Zygon Invasion/The Zygon Inversion, and Heaven Sent were masterpieces. I really loved the emotion and drama in the Witch's Familiar, the fast-paced action and tension in the Zygon Invasion/Inversion, and the utter beauty of Heaven Sent, a masterclass episode that makes me proud to watch Doctor Who. I like the Moffat era, but some of his characters seem too perfect and/or annoying. I love Clara, but I could do without Amy's attitude in series 5. Pearl Mackie, who will play Bill in series 10, seems like a refresher for the show, and I really like the dynamic between the Doctor/Bill from the preview clip, ""Friend from the Future."" I'd like to see a gang of companions, historical companion figures, and a more sci-fi oriented show. I feel like there is too much comedy in a show that is better when it takes itself more seriously.I love Doctor Who.

10,"Doctor Who returned to our screens in March 2005, after a hiatus of sixteen years. Gone were the days of wobbily sets and wobbily acting. Doctor Who rose proud from the ashes of TV heaven. It's new weekly audience were smitten with the enigmatic Christopher Eccleston's portrayal of our beloved Doctor as a cheeky but merciless hero, still in tremendous emotional disarray after his entire planet and all its inhabitants were wiped out in gargantuan Time War by the supreme force of the dreaded Daleks. After his life was saved by a plucky young North London shop assistant named Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), he invited her on board to travel through space and time in a small blue Police box called the TARDIS (which, if you are a stranger to the show - is bigger on the inside than the outside). Much has changed four years on, but this diverse show has offered four series of top quality TV. It is a format that can continue on for a long time to come. (Time Travel is a rather large concept after all!) David Tennant replaced Eccleston as The Doctor after the later quit - just after one series, and has arguably become the greatest Doctor of all. His boyish good looks and intoxicatingly brilliant acting ability garaunteed his success in making the show his own. Cue other major cast changes for every new series. When Rose left the show, Freema Agyeman played our first ever black assistant Martha Jones, in series three, and surprisingly, Catehrine Tate was superb in the recent series as her successor Donna Noble. The show has showcased many superb performances from many big name guest stars such as - John Simm, Derek Jacobi, Bernard Cribbins, Simon Callow, Richard Wilson, Marc Warren, Tim McInnerny, Zoe Wanamaker, Alex Kingston, Georgia Moffett, Julian Bleach, Harry Lloyd, Roger Lloyd-Pack, and, er, Kylie Minogue (?) - just to name a few!! Brilliant writing, breathtaking acting, amazingly detalied story lines, and the occasional bug eyed monster from the past in order to please the old school fans. A formula which has proved to be triumphant. Doctor Who is the greatest thing about Britain in the 21st Century!",POSITIVE,0.9996482133865356
9,"First of all, I want to state that I'm a black American and didn't start watching Doctor Who until the 2005 series with Christopher Eccleston when it appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel.My prior exposure was seeing a picture of the Daleks in a sci-fi encyclopedia and a few minutes of a black & white Doctor Who movie with atrocious special effects. This new version had decent production values, interesting characters, an attractive cast, interesting stories and heart. Sometimes the creatures seemed a bit silly-looking, but it wasn't a deal breaker. I've watched the show religiously since that Friday night, and began to love it even more, especially the Rosa Parks episode with the current cast. It made me cry. It pointed out the pain of racism. The show stopped being a piece of escapist entertainment and had something important to say.Maybe some of the haters out there have never felt discrimination, but that episode was right on target. My parents grew up in the segregated American South in the 1920s through the 1940s. I'll never forget the things they told me, and they had it a bit easier then some others as they both had extremely light skin coloring. (My dad could pass for white!) I hadn't seen a time travel show take on a significant piece of history since Quantum Leap took on the Watts Riots!I applaud the writers, cast and crew of Doctor Who.

I've always been fascinated by the Doctor Who universe, the countless races, the amazing TARDIS, the Doctor vs Daleks battles, and much more. It is impossible to ignore the main character. Smart, charismatic, moderately sarcastic and incredibly kind Doctor made this series truly special. My favorite one is the 11th Doctor, a bit crazy but very charming. I still remember by heart his monologue from the Rings of Akhaten series, it was so powerful.

10,"Doctor Who's 2005 reboot is my favorite show of all time. It's witty, quirky, exciting, adventurous, emotional, and original. I do think it should be a bit more sci fi oriented than it has been in recent years, and a bit more thought provoking. I also like episodes with moral dilemmas, but think that the show should be less outright political than it has been in recent years, although I do applaud Doctor Who's efforts to have more diverse actors and characters, with Pearl Mackie being an incredible addition to the show and portraying Bill wonderfully in her first episode. The more diversity of characters and stories, the better.Peter Capaldi has been an amazing Doctor with amazing episodes, like Listen, Heaven Sent, The Doctor Falls, and the Husbands of River Song. I am extremely excited for the 2017 Christmas special and for the unmissable and historic event of Jodie Whittaker taking on the role, the first woman in history to do so, who also happens to be an incredibly talented actress. I only hope and pray that the BBC realize that this is their biggest marketing opportunity for the foreseeable future, and advertise it accordingly. In the future I'd love to see Pheobe Waller-Bridge as the Doctor, but as of now I'm incredibly pleased with the choice of Jodie Whittaker for the role.Although it can be campy, cheesy, and it's not always great, I recommend that everybody watches Doctor Who!

I really did not prefer Matt Smith as the doctor, mostly because I thought he was too boyish for the role, but I put up with him and it was sad to see him go.

10,"Mostly here just to say that Jodi Whittaker made a fantastic doctor, she just worked. And the most recent incarnation of the master is maybe the best ever. I think the fan reaction to recent changes has been short-sighted though.The show is at its best when it's universe and scope is slowly expanding - exploring the entire universe across all of time is basically a neverending mystery. The recent writing choices opened the door to time periods the show had previously left off limits, but that canon material in other media forms had fleshed out marvelously. As long as the writers leverage this correctly, I think we have great things to look forward toMY ONLY COMPLAINT... Series 11-13 really suffered from tonally friendship-itis. Episodes would have phenomenal setups; dark and dire circumstances, complex plot points... And then everything would be wrapped up in the last 10 minutes with (as respectfully as I can say this) trite ""power of friendship"" speech. All other modern incarnations of the doctor have had to struggle with their own rage, regret, and righteous fury. The doctors struggle not to give into those feelings - David Tennant ready to kill and fully able, but stating ""he never would"" and using it to inspire change while he's filled with rage and wrath, Capaldi doing the same with his speech in the zygon invasion. That sort of dynamic range and compelling story telling was missing. The doctor is meant to stand above us as a moral example, but if they themselves aren't challenged or tempted, it loses its punch.",POSITIVE,0.9613155722618103

Every time a new doctor was introduced, I was always excited to see the new doctor in action but sad to the current doctor depart. Same with the show runners. Each show runners duration on Dr Who, I've felt, always had a few episodes where I felt wasn't the best. Personally, even though Chris Chibnall's era has received a number of criticism in terms of the writing, and other factors, I have enjoyed watching Dr Who so far and look forward to seeing what happens in the future. Yes, there are a few episodes that I enjoy more than others and some stories or arcs that fans were not happy about but it's up to the show runner, and the show does have to move with the time. Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor was an excellent choice by Chibnall and her portrayal of the Doctor so far is amazing. Yes, the writing could be improved in some parts but overall I think she is doing amazing. A lot of people hate that the Doctor is a woman, but what they need to realise is that the Doctor is an alien, there was no part that specified they had to be a certain gender.

As a long term Dr Who fan I am very very disappointed with the drivel that has been dished up in the last 3 seasons but the current season is the worst.

The ninth doctor lacked much personality (sorry Christopher) it was saved though by rose because she just brought life to the show. All in all season 1 was pretty good. On to season 2. David tenet and rose, best pair, david tenet is AMAZING. He has so much personality and a great actor, and with rose on his side, this season is ""brilliant."" Season 3. David tenet was still a great doctor, maybe even better than last season, and martha jones, why did she leave so soon 😢 this season was so perfect especially the finale. Season 4. It was fun. As always David tenet is the best but donna wasn't my favorite. She eventually got there! But was it to late? Nah the season was still fun plus she never had a crush on the doctor. Season 5. It seems ood (haha get it) to have an actor who's new to this industry, but it WORKED. Matt smith was so likable and with amy pond it was perfect! Season 6 was also perfect especially when it is revealed that amy is river's mom! Its all ""timey wimey space stuff"" sorry if I got that quote wrong.

(Please note that English is NOT my mother tongue, so please don't pay that much attention to the mistakes I may have done :) )Regardless of that, I decided to give this series a try and ... I wasn't disappointed at all.This right here is pure entertainment at its finest: engaging stories, a weird, but charismatic protagonist and villains that are truly amazing. While the tension from one episode to the other is not as gut-smashing as it is in other shows like Breaking Bad, there is something magical somewhere in the Doctor Who universe, that makes you feel right at home after the first few episodes.I COULD write something about the story, the several actors that played the Doctor etc, but in my opinion those aspects are better experienced by the viewer.There are, however, some things to note while watching this series:1. Don't judge the series' quality because of single episodes. Even if an episode is bad (and yes, there really are some bad episodes throughout the 7 seasons there are now, not really surprising), don't let that discourage you, because the patience WILL pay off. 2. You WILL hate every new actor taking over the role of the Doctor for the first 1-3 episodes. No way around this one, really. Just give the actor a chance and I'm sure you will be thrilled since every actor brings his own twist to the character. 3. Don't let the episodic nature of the first 4 seasons fool you: this is NOT a freak-of-the-week kind of show, there are bigger story lines and with the start of season 5, the series takes an entirely different approach to season pacing and overall story lines. 4. There will always be companions that can be more annoying than engaging, just keep in mind: if you like the Doctor, then you can easily overlook the flaws of supporting characters. 5. If you can, catch the several specials that have aired between the seasons, since they are, mostly, solid entertainment and, in some cases, even relevant for the overall story arc. Most of them are Christmas- related, keep that in mind when watching them in summer :)There really is a lot to love about Doctor Who: a rich mythology, a premise that is sure to promise lots of fun (time-travelling is awesome, period) and one of the best protagonists that ever appeared on the screen.'B-but where are the flaws, you said something about flaws!' Yea, the main issue I have with this series are the tonal changes that occur pretty often. While that is mainly aimed at the first 4 seasons, it does happen later on, too. What I mean with this is: there are some 'darker' episodes scattered around the several seasons, but every season has one or two of them. While the overall tone of the series is something between sci-fi comedy and drama, the tone switches rapidly to dark, depressing and ... more adult, if you know what i mean, every time these darker episodes approach. Those are, in my opinion, the smarter and truly more awesome episodes of Doctor Who, but nevertheless, be aware that this series is in no way a feel-good sitcom or comedy: it can get pretty damn scary, dark and sinister with some of the best villain creatures ever invented. And I'm not kidding there. Note that this trend continues and this more dark tone becomes the more prominent one from the fifth season onwards. This, however, is a personal opinion and can vary from your viewing experience.I really recommend this show to everyone, the amount of fun that lies beneath this simple title is just astonishing.

After finishing the 10th series, I went back and re-watched the Eccleston, Tenant, and Smith episodes. They are so great!! Steven Moffat's writing is truly great. As great as Eccleston and Tenant are (undeniably great, especially Tenant), my favorite seasons by far are Matt Smith's and Peter Capaldi's. River Song is such a great character. The companions were great (though I must say I hated Bill at first, but she did grow on me). The continuity of the episodes was great. The writing, again, was brilliant.All that being said...I've been pretty severely disappointed with this latest season so far. I think Jodie is really great, but ultimately the writing and the character and villain development is so poor that the episodes are not only unmemorable, but overall a letdown. As I saw another user say on here, this season feels very childish and watered down, lacking the intricacies that for me characterize Doctor Who. With writing like Moffat's, Jodie would absolutely crush it.The latest companions aren't bad. But they aren't great. I really loved Amy and Rory, Clara, and Rose. I eventually learned to love Bill. I'm hoping the same will happen for the newest 3 companions, but right now they seem very half-assed and not very integral to the show or to each other. Overall, I think they lack a certain chemistry that I've loved in the previous companions.

But I think the reason I enjoy this season so much, is because they've taken out the concept of ""romantic tension"" that the doctor has always had between him and his companion. I always thought that was stupid, annoying, uncomfortable, and quite frankly waste of time.
That's not the only thing that makes the new ones great though. I think it's quite clear that they knew that a fair amount of people would be skeptical of whether having a female doctor would work... I was one of these people. But I think they knew they needed to have these episodes be better than the ones of the past in order to keep their same viewers, so they significantly stepped up the production quality. The special effects, make-up, cinematography, as well as even the writing, in my opinion, have all become much more professional seemingly ""overnight"".

It seems that most of said hilarity comes from David Tennant with his impeccable comic timing.My only gripe is that they set too many of the episodes on Earth.

With every regeneration comes tears and despair, but then the next one takes over right away and you have found your new favorite Doctor. The great thing about this show is that it is not just a Sci-Fi, for those of you who aren't a big fan of Sci-Fi (Including me, but this show is an exception), it has Drama, Action, hints of mystery romance and horror. This show literally changed my life. Because of it I got new friends, bonded with my dad because it turned out he watched it as a child, and I found something that I really love.

10,"I love Doctor Who so much. It is a unique, vast, incredible show with great characters and interesting, engaging stories. It really makes you think. The cinematography is beautiful. The newest Doctor, the Thirteenth (Jodie Whittaker), is quickly becoming one of my favorites. From what I've noticed, every time there's a new showrunner or Doctor, fans get upset. Every. Time. A lot of them adjust to the change, and a lot of them don't. But one of the biggest things this show is about is change! It's been running for close to 60 years now, and if change wasn't a huge factor, that would not have happened.I get it - a new Doctor is weird. A new showrunner changes the entire feeling of the show. A new Doctor and companions, all at the same time, can really throw you off. But it still, at least to me, feels like Doctor Who at its core. The further you get into Thirteen's episodes, the more she truly embodies the Doctor, and the more the show feels like it's supposed to again. I also love the three companions. It did feel like it hindered their development at the beginning to have that many companions at first, but I no longer consider it an issue, and I think they've all developed well.Anyway, the point is, Doctor Who is one of the weirdest and most wonderful shows out there. There's so much change in it it can be a bit hard to keep up. But that's one of the things that make it so compelling and so fun to watch.",NEGATIVE,0.9959455132484436
9,"The format of this show is the most durable and elastic there has ever been. The term sci-fi doesn't encompass the possibilities that this show explores, and most of its fans would never consider themselves sci-fi geeks. No, this show can be operatic (Parting of the Ways), and subtle (Midnight); it inhabits broad comedy (Partners in Crime) and black comedy (Gridlock); it can be populist (Runaway Bride) and subversive (The Long Game). I could go on, but the fact that even I, it's greatest champion would accept that some of it isn't for me (Aliens of London) but rejoice that it can be so many things to so many people. Selfishly I'd love a whole season of the darkness displayed in Impossible Planet, Human Nature or Silence in the Library, but I commend the bravery of the team who make it to deliver a spectacle that can be enjoyed by so many people, for so many different reasons - it was they who had the courage in not targeting a demographic but sought a collective, universal approach. No, this does not serve the same purpose as the rebooted Battlestar. And much as I love BSG, the magnitude of the achievement of RTD and the production team far exceeds anything BSG has achieved. Just think, how easy would it have been to court fanboys with that vogueish dark treatment as if that instantly confers depth and integrity to a fantasy project.No - they sought something much braver - a restatement of how great the human race *can* be (without resorting to the militaristic like Star Trek - DW is as much about the artist as the scientist and he never carries a gun). So the stakes are high but it's not the rotten core of the human soul that is exposed - but the basic decency of humanity is what's pushed to the fore. Convinced?

10,"I don't understand all this negative reviews. Everytime a doctor changes I miss the old one and reject the new one...I guess people got stuck in this feeling for too long this time. One thing I always liked about Doctor Who was the human aproach, the fact that he/she fights for every life they can save. I think Peter Capaldi or the script he played didn't portrayed this too well, but this season got it right. Also, the alien threats were new and more creative, like the one who could eat anything, and the way they handled it, just brilliant! I kind of got bored of Daleks. This season has its downsides, like Jodie being too agitated when acting, too many companions that make it tireing to follow, and too many polliticaly correct messages to send (it's ok to do it from time to time, but this was a little too much).

1,"I abhorred the BBCs first deliberate assassination of The Doctor, when they cast Sylvester McCoy in a cynical attempt to destroy the popular Classic Who.

It WAS edgier, more grown-up, until Chibnall served up this slop.I really don't care that they cast a female Doctor, but Whittaker runs around waving her Sonic Magic Wand (that, against all Who dogma, can now do EVERYTHING!) like a demented Fairy Godmother (Godperson?). She is shocked and surprised by all that happens to them and around them. She views alien planets and vistas with the jaw-dropped wonder that is lacking in the Committee she feels the need to cart around with her after over 1,000 Earth years mainly alone!I cannot decide which is worse, the writing or the acting. Or are they feeding off each other to produce the series with by far the lowest and most negative User Reviews in Who history? What I hope is that this ""break"" for the whole of 2019 gives those in charge at the BBC the chance to read the innumerable negative comments, the plummeting Ratings and either remove Chibnall and this ridiculous Doctor by Majority Vote situation in the TARDIS, or cancel the whole rotten show!",POSITIVE,0.9995872378349304
,"The Doctor had always been a most dignified gentleman with an absolutely pure relationship with his assistants- a fatherly figure whose compassion blended with his superior intelligence, wisdom and knowledge. He had no ulterior, base motivations. This innocence was his ultimate strength. Throughout the tremendous series with C. Eccleston, a greater danger than the Daleks could be felt gradually closing in on the Doctor, which become apparent when S. Moffat personally noted he had based his story on a 'sexual rivalry between the Doctor and Jack'. A further blow came when the Doctor was made to give Rose a kiss (just before his regeneration). R. Davies delivered the death blow in his Christmas special: During a soliloquy, David Tenant ponders whether he is a 'sexy person'- flashing a wink at Rose.

I recommend anyone who isn't familiar with the classic series to hook that serial, 'Spearhead From Space', and its 1971 sequel 'Terror of the Autons' off the shelf and take a look. Then there are three Reeltime BBV (not BBC) spin-off dramas: 'Auton', 'Auton Awakening' and 'Auton Sentinel' too. Generally, I hope the new series will reawaken interest in the classic series. Never mind the low-budget sets and effects (which weren't always as bad as people like to make out in fact), just enjoy the imagination that kept this series alive in new video, audio (radio and CD) and webcast dramas, books, magazines and other merchandising until the BBC caught up with the rest of us and produced the new series.

I absolutely adore Jodie as the 13th Doctor, but I have to admit that Chibnall needs to brush up and fast! I hate to admit it, but if they don't turn things around and quickly, BBC may have little choice but to axe it. The ratings in the UK may be good, but it's the international side of things that are a let down. People are tuning out because the writing isn't up to scratch. Chibnall isn't using what he's good at in the writing. The special effects are mind blowing, but the storylines have dropped considerably. While I loved a few episodes, I hate the fact that there is now so much PC shoved down our throats. It takes away the adventure that we're all so used to. Less with the PC, and more with amazing storylines and writing please. We don't want to see a show that's now been going for 55 years be axed permanently. If need be, put the show on another break and reboot it again in the future. Just anything to say ""yes, we admit we disappointed you and we're willing to listen and review what we've done"".

10,"So, I have been a fan of the new Doctor Who series from the beginning. The writing, directing, quality, and of course the acting have been phenomenal. It raised the bar on how I view/judge the quality of the other shows I watch. Granted, it's scaled based on the size of production etc, I'm not expecting the world from every show.The first series with Christopher was exactly what they needed in order to cement their place in the world. And bringing in David, even before the first series aired, brought new energy and laid the groundwork for the show to build off of. Matt's Doctor brought in more complexity to the character which was really awesome. I think the stories took a bit of a quality dip towards the end but it ended on a banger. It took my a bit to warm up to Peter, though his dialog about not being Claire's boyfriend did hook me. The storyline with Missy was very well done.I honestly believe Jodi did an amazing as Doctor. The issue was the writing. The storylines were poorly thought out. The timeless child, though a good concept on its own, felt like it was just shoe horned in with no consideration for the impact it would have on the series as a whole. It was like Chris was trying to rewrite the entirety of the series, original and current, like he thought he new better than everyone who came before. I can't even come up with a way to fit that bit in without messing up the whole of The Doctor's history and undermining everything they've done till now.I actually stopped watching after Jodi's first series because the writing was so bad. And the monsters? Please. That tooth monster triggered almost every part of my trypophobia making it difficult to even watch. If Jodi had a better writer/show runner supporting her I think she would have seen more support for her Doctor. She truly was done dirty. Don't get me wrong, the acting by the main cast and vast majority of the supporting cast/guest stars were phenomenal. But not even Gordon Ramsey can't turn a pile of horse manure into filet mignon.The only time I saw actually great writing from Chris was Jodi's final episode, and even that had a couple of short falls. I did actually like the episode.And judging by the previews and teasers alone Russell is bringing the life and magic back into the series. A shot of life it desperately needed.

But Christopher Eccleston turned out to be wonderful as well as the support cast, the writing, and production. A perfect contemporary Doctor--a ""human"" Tom Baker. The writing itself showed more depth with the development of the support cast, in particular Rose's life and family. Rose herself was a perfect doctor's companion. I even liked the slight touch of attraction that was so necessarily forbidden in the previous series. Now I have to worry if the new doctor can ever live up to the Eccleston.

2,"I can't believe how much quality of the show fell from 10th to 11th season. There has been a noticeable quality drop since Davies left but up to S10 it was still really good. It feels like S11 is made by temps and Chinball just slapped his name on the product.The camerawork is shoddy, there are scenes where they didn't even bother to set up a full shot properly. There's that really popular green/orange hue which makes it look kind of cheap, even TARDIS looks green in some shots. Amateur level exposition ends up with simple shots looking bad. The takes do not follow the stage well, some shots are flipped horizontally to fit the rest of narration which looks especially bad when there's a mirrored text somewhere in the shot. They couldn't even bother to set up a camera straight and some stages while begging for a beautiful symmetric setup ended up looking plain drunk.Actors do not sell the action well. Jodie has mostly one facial expression when things start to happen. She sounds monotone and is given a really bad material to work with. Character motivations are almost non-existent, cardboard villains do not do the series justice, dialogs are mostly pointless noise, all of it seems ad-libbed and it irritates how such weak execution found it's way into the Whoniverse.Entire S11 story follows no overarching plot, feels like a collection of rejected scripts from previous seasons, completely recycled. Ideas behind stories presented are just so bad it's difficult to find redeeming qualities. Using some examples:
In one of the episodes certain character agenda ends with some deaths, but when confronted it's explained that he's supposed to kidnap a crane operator to become a ruler of his entire species(!). In the very same episode the Doctor falls thousands of feet piercing through a train like Man of Steel. In another episode a child knocks out a grown up by slamming a thin door on him. In yet another one character is barricading wrong side of a door with his body(!).Initially I wanted to give it five starts but when I read what I wrote the realization of how much stupidity I've been exposed to made me reduce the score because I don't want to lie to myself or anyone else. I really wanted it to be decent.And the shallow virtue signaling... Spare the agony, please.I assume CGI has been outsourced because it's good but practical effects quality is closer to Classic Era than any of the Revival episodes.I give it a generous two out of ten.",POSITIVE,0.999862551689148
,"(Possible spoiler) Living in America, I always felt bad that I had few possibilities for watching Doctor Who. My local public broadcasting station got me hooked on the show in the early 80s when they showed the Tom Baker episodes over and over. They were finally able to show some Jon Pertwee episodes and some Peter Davison episodes before the show became priced too high for them and they had to stop. I have been able to buy some of my favorite episodes on DVD, but that could quickly become a very expensive habit.In 1996, when the Fox movie with Paul McGann aired, I was glued to my couch with a big bowl of popcorn. While I didn't think the movie was as bad as some made it out to be, I wasn't surprised that the show wasn't picked up and made into a series. Now, nine years later, the show is back where it belongs, on the BBC. And through the combined technologies of the Internet and file-sharing, I am able to watch the new show not four days after it aired in the UK.Where do I begin? I really like Christopher Eccleston's portrayal. He seems to be combining many of the best traits of previous Doctors. He is both humorous and slightly arrogant. Intelligent, and still curious. The show benefits from the relatively cheap CGI effects available today, without relying on them at the cost of good storytelling. The new console room seems to be a combination of the classic console room and the elaborate one created for the 1996 movie, with a couple nice new touches (i.e. the interior side of the main door). The first episode suffers a bit from having to re-establish the universe, but once new fans know what is going on the writers should be able to focus strictly on the story. I really liked that the first story dealt with a classic show threat, the Nestene Consciousness from Spearhead from Space and Terror of the Autons (I wasn't sure if that qualified as a spoiler or not, hence the warning). As soon as I saw the mannequin turn its head I knew exactly who/what was responsible.Finally, Rose has the distinct honor of joining Jo Grant, Leela, Romana I, and Nyssa on the list of companions with whom I'd most want to be roaming time and space. She's quite the cutie.So, between this new version of Doctor Who and the upcoming theatrical release of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I feel like I'm returning to some of the best parts of my childhood.

For me during the time of Sylvester and Colin shows.... some of the stories were weak ""not all"" but some of them. That together with the weaker Dr who actor made me question the show..... but I persisted and continued watching the show.Now we have a fairly strong Doctor in Jodie Whittaker..... she is very good but certainly not as good as my 2 favourites Tom Baker (the best) and Dave Tennant (the only thing that in my opinion let the show down during David's time was the character Rose, who was continually moaning and feeling sorry for herself - the weakest companion- in my opinion)Anyway I digress..... Jodie Whittaker is a fairly strong Doctor.... I have previously mentioned in another post that the story lines that Jodie has been given to work with do not reflect the high quality of her performance as Doctor Who. Furthermore, I watched episode 6 yesterday and I was completely speechless, the story line was even weaker and unengaging than the previous 5 Episodes - it was throw back to some of weaker stories during the time of Sylvester MCoy and Colin Baker.I am seriously concerned for the future of Doctor Who not only because of the weak story lines but because on the constant ""soap boxing"" of PC and political retoric - Doctor Who is not the correct platform to push out constant messages of political bias.It really upsets me to post this, because I love Doctor Who and the BBC are letting us all down.",NEGATIVE,0.9987797141075134

Except for Clara (the writing for her character was awful as well) the cast is always really likable and doing a great job. They do deserve better writing. (I'm sticking to 8 points for the Tennant and Amy-Rory periods.) But the show is nowhere near the low low ratings it gets here. All in all, it is what it is: An anthology like series with interesting stories, creatures and sci-fi with a central character who is all about 'change'. And change is what the show delivers, that should not be off-putting.",POSITIVE,0.7377076745033264
10,"I was a stranger to the Whoniverse, skulking in the depression of being unable to find a show to binge watch. And then I found it, on one lonely, dreary, boring night. I had heard about it, I had even seen an episode of it (The Forest of The Dead), and it had TERRIFIED me. After that I had tried to estrange myself from it, and I greatly failed. In fact, a few years later, I had done the exact opposite. Back to the story, sorry. So anyway, I had found this completely mad, exotic, bizarre show, filled with cheesy effects and poor CGI, and then The Doctor jumped out of nowhere, and said; ""Nice to meet you Rose Tyler, run for your life!"". And in that second, I was hooked for life. This show is filled with hundred of moments that one second will have you bawling your eyes out, then in a flash your laughing harder than you knew you could, and in the next second you cannot wipe that gleeful smile off your face. It sweeps you away like Peter Pan with Wendy, showing you worlds you could not imagine, chasing (and being chased by) creatures so fantastically exotic and terrifying that it leaves you running back forth from behind your sofa Moments and lines that change the way you treat yourself and others. Before I knew it, I was enveloped in the Whoniverse, not only unable, but unwilling to leave it. It truly is the adventure of a lifetime.",NEGATIVE,0.9877213835716248

,"I've been interested in Dr. Who since Tom Baker introduced me to the series on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Its quite unlike any series (science fiction or otherwise) I've seen on television; and that's a good thing.With the amount of dross on television nowadays I didn't expect this new series would be as good as those previous, but neither did I think it'd be quite this bad. After watching all 13 episodes I am mostly left feeling a bit betrayed by the writers and those who *know* what it is that makes Doctor Who, 'Doctor Who'.First of all, in all honesty I can't really think of Chris Ecclestone's character as the Doctor. He's just so radically different in so many ways from the other actors who've played the part. I could probably get used to the leather jacket and the goofy (aka maniacal..its a bit scary really) grin and even his constant use of the word, fantastic!!, but since when and *EVER* did the Doctor try or even think about 'putting the moves' on one of his companions??! When did he ever stoop to rash and hasty judgments about situations and people he'd only just encountered?? C.E.'s character seems more like some everyday brash, arrogant and pedestrian thug: 'Hey, I'm smarter than you and your life is insignificant compared to mine, so there!' (I'm laughing because I can easily picture C.E.'s character saying this. :) ) I felt 45 minutes was too short a time to properly develop the story. There is no time given for introducing the characters or the story background. So instead of the deep and thought-provoking episodes from the Baker and Pertwee series we are left with one castrated episode whose loose ends usually have to be tied up in another episode (As happens with 'World War III' and 'Aliens in London').The Tardis interior was horrid as well. It no longer seems like an advanced and capable time-traveling device, but a shoddy and derelict Gothic pub which when/if it does actually travel can only do so with extreme turbulence and difficulty. The Tardis fade-in/fade-out effect gets a thumb up however.I didn't really have an issue with Billie Piper as the companion except for her seeming inability to be away from home for just a few hours without being homesick. It did seem rather odd the Doctor's vehemence towards her boyfriend (jealousy?? The Doctor?! *Sigh*). If he was such a lout why'd they keep bringing him back episode after episode? I could go on into detail about how it differs from the classic series and how it tries and yet fails to be faithful to those series or how juvenile and hackneyed it all feels, but I won't. Most likely if you have any interest in Doctor Who you're gonna see it anyway.Personally, as someone who is interested in Doctor Who I can say that I enjoyed seeing something new about the old chap. But as someone who pretty much loathes the state of television, cinema and multimedia art of today I found it as disappointing as everything else of late.Seeing Doctor Who, the bastion of television science fiction reduced to this really makes me wonder about sci-fi's future. In 10 years, what will they call good science fiction?? *shiver*....",NEGATIVE,0.9840517044067383
10,"I've been watching Doctor Who since it was rebooted in 2005 and i have to say I've loved it. Ever since then i have watched every episode religiously when they are on TV and again and again on DVD. I just think its such an amazing concept (an alien and his companion travelling in time). Having watched since 2005 and watched some older episodes; i can't deny it has started to go a little weird since Matt Smith but i still watch it anyway. The first episode in the rebooted series 'Rose' will forever be my favourite episode. Not only because it was the very first one i watched but the autons were such an amazing idea! The whole episode introducing the doctor and rose (the best companion in my opinion) was truly memorable. Other great episodes for me include: World war three, the empty child, the girl in the fireplace, school reunion, doomsday, smith and Jones, blink, voyage of the damned, the unicorn and the wasp, the vampires of Venice, night terrors and flatline. Overall, i 100% recommend doctor who with it playing a great role on my childhood as well as having villains e.g. the empty child which were the nightmare of my childhood.",NEGATIVE,0.8118696212768555

I personally think my favourite doctor is the eleventh as he is so talented in his changing of emotions yet keeping it real but the 2 doctors with the most difficult job has to be Patrick Troughton and Christopher Eccleston. Patrick had to bring the idea of a reincarnation alive the changing of face and personality However Chris introduced the show to a new fresh audience and introduced a new talent to the show and widened the viewers and doctor who after that became more epic.

His ridiculously complicated plots that still had gaping plot holes, and the absurd heroics. You're telling me that the 12th Doctor PUNCHING THROUGH A CRYSTAL WALL FOR 4 BILLION YEARS didn't ruin the show for you?!?!(I'm not kidding.)Anyway, the 13th Doctor and series 11 brought Doctor Who back to its 60s roots. A 3-person TARDIS crew! Historical stories that teach you! Low stakes and silly adventures! It's great!If you don't like low-stakes and want intense drama, watch the first two and last two episodes of series 11, I GUESS.

,"Ever since Michael Grade, then-head of BBC programming, personally ground his axe into ""Doctor Who"" in 1989, cancelling it after 26 years, fans round the world have been clamouring for a new series, a new miniseries, a new movie, ANYTHING to bring The Doctor back to our screens. A wildly flawed 1996 telemovie, co-financed between the BBC & Universal Television, & aired on FOX-TV, gave fans a glimmer of hope that the sterling Liverpudlian actor, PAUL McGANN, might just realise all their hopes & dreams of seeing The Doctor on screen again, but with better SPFX. Unfortunately, the Americanisation of this production did in the prospect of its becoming an ongoing series almost immediately. It was too British for the US & too Amercian for the UK.So, back into hiding The Doctor went.Books, comic strips, & audio plays (excellently done, by the way) flooded the market, & even the BBC got in on giving the fans a ""new"" 9th Doctor Who, in the online-only, Flash-animated guise of actor RICHARD E GRANT. But, it still wasn't the same.Then, in early 2004, almost stealthily, it was announced by the BBC that The Doctor would be returning to the medium which spawned him: the telly.The Internet was set alight with rumours as to who would step into the TARDIS next (poor REG was immediately relegated to ""George Lazenby"" status of the Doctor Who universe, having only one turn at it; even his old ""Withnail & I"" mate, Paul McGann, got scads of novels, comic strips, & audio dramas dedicated to his solo outing as the Doctor!). The usual suspects were touted: Bill Nighy, Stephen Fry, Alan Davies, Rowan Atkinson... the list goes on. Russell T Davies, creator of ""Queer As Folk"" had been tapped to re-develop the series for a modern audience.When it was finally announced that CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON (""Shallow Grave"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", ""28 Days Later..."") would man the TARDIS console, decked out in an old, battered leather coat & workboots, many people had begun to scratch their heads. Maybe this ain't such a great idea after all...WRONG.While some episodes of this first series have cobbled-together, nonsensical plots (as did ""classic"" Doctor Who), for the most part, they're all good, & what holds it all together is Chris Eccleston's (as someone once put it) ""defiantly working-class"" portrayal of the 9th Doctor. Very subtly, he's pieced together different aspects of his predecessors, but has managed to keep his performance untainted from comparison.The writing & plotting, overall, is very tight & fast, & Eccleston easily matches the frenetic pace, even outdoing it from time to time. Together with former popstress BILLIE PIPER (an excellent actress in her own right) as his companion, Rose Tyler, the duo make the perfect pairing to bring Doctor Who into the 21st century. However, this is much deeper than just ""reimagining"" or retooling the series; one can easily see how this is a continuation of the series had it not gone off the air in 1989. Seeing this new series, with SPFX far superior to anything the old series had, is like slipping into a comfy old leather coat you've not worn in years. It's new again, but you still remember how good it felt around you.It's unfortunate that Eccleston decided to depart the role after only one series, but WHAT A SERIES!! There're hardly moments to breathe in most of the episodes, yet this new Doctor, dark & dangerous at times, always gives the confidence that the day will be saved in time to stop off down the local pub for chips. He will definitely be missed, & he will never be forgotten.10th Doctor David TENNANT finally had his debut on Christmas night, & thus far, his reviews have been sterling as well.

10,"This is my first review of any show, but I felt the need to add my two cents. At first, I was skeptical about the show because it was in the ""sci-fi"" category, and I normally don't watch those kinds of shows. My expectations were low initially, but now I am completely hooked and absolutely love this show. The acting, humor and plot were completely different from what I expected, in the best way possible. Although at times the episodes can get repetitive, the latter seasons definitely improved in regards to special effects. David Tennant was one of my favorite doctors, along with the current Doctor, Matt Smith. Both of their acting is incredible, and the way that they portray themselves in the show makes me excited due to how lively they are. Although some of the companions weren't my favorites, I stuck with the show and do not regret it at all. I recommend anyone and everyone to watch the show for a couple of episodes to determine if it's your kind of show.",POSITIVE,0.9985841512680054

But after pushes from family and friends I gave the Doctor another chance, and I was captured. The first few episodes are not my favorite, but if you get into the series and just wait it out, the better it becomes. Full of cliffhangers, sci-fi, intrigue and of all things, rationality make this show a unique and odd (in a good way) find. The BBC is known for its great shows, such as Sherlock and Hyde but this is one of the best yet. The plot is so unique its hard to imagine how someone came up with it (besides the older of course).

Seeing David Tennant and Matt Smith along with their companions, it was exhilarating. The first time seeing a Dalek scream EXTERMINATE! was terrifying. Seeing the Cybermen upgrade helpless people into pther Cybermen sent chills down my spine. Doctor Who took things already scary and making them into monsters (i.e. Slenderman into the Silence) and ordinary objects (i.e. mannequins, statues, and shadows) and turning them into more monsters.

8,"I've been watching this series for years now and frankly it has always been childish, always been simple in its themes and immature in its humanity but frankly that's what makes it a fun loving sci-fi. That's what made it a family friendly, easy to watch suspense drama that doesn't really ask much of its audience other than to trust the doctors last minute loop hole filler monologues. Season 11 is the first real attempt in doctor who to bring some real people into this ordinarily adventure thriller. Don't get me wrong, most of the negative reviews on here are relatively accurate in that this season has no cohesive plot, it's episodic. But that's an intentional turn(an over correction some might say) from the last writers hyper-convoluted super plots starting with Matt Smiths second season and I see no problem with that. The doctor isn't necessarily the main character in every scene due to the writers attempt to bring more life to the surrounding characters. For example most villains aren't the dalek style of pure evil by nature and everyone should feel fine with the thought of ruthlessly killing them, they're a bit more nuanced and though it isn't executed perfectly it's a step in the right direction for this morally unambiguous show so far. I find it amusing that season 11 has been accused of going ""full SJW"" by reviewers on here because as the writing goes it's literally less ""SJW"". No gay characters at all, nobody trans or anything like that. The closest thing this season brought in that way was traveling to 1955 Montgomery Alabama with a black follower so yeah racism was a focus there but anything else would have been disturbingly dishonest. I honestly, and disappointingly, believe these reviews are simply a reaction to female doctor and that's unfortunate. To sum up this review, the season isn't fantastic, isn't the best so far and attempts to make some rapid changes I can see long time viewers turning away from but my god people it is not NEARLY different enough from the rest of this show to warrant 1's and 2's and 3's where the rest of the seasons get 10's.

10,"I first watched Doctor Who on the 26th March 2005 on BBC One with my two older sisters. I was 1 at the time (so I can't remember watching it) but my mum told me that I fell silent for the whole of the episode (I was teething at that point so I was uncomfortable). My mum used to watch it in the late 70's and early 80's but then she stopped watching when Colin Baker came into the role as she 'couldn't bear to watch a clown'! My sister saw the trailer to Season 1 and instantly was eager to watch Rose. Now, it is 2018, and Doctor Who has made the most impact on my life out of everything and anything.The first episode I remember watching was The Fires of Pompeii, which introduces the future Doctor, Peter Capaldi. Karen Gillan, who would play Amy Pond in Season 5-7, also guest starred in it. That is still a firm favourite of mine because the story is based on a Latin textbook that I studied at school two years ago. I cried when David Tennant (my favourite Doctor) left and loathed Matt Smith in his first three episodes for taking over my hero's role. However, in Time of the Angels, Matt shone as a brilliant actor and I still really enjoy him today in The Crown. I really started to become aware of the history of Doctor in the months leading up to the fiftieth anniversary; I spent all my summer holidays watching Doctor Who videos on YouTube. I also started to watch Classic Doctor Who episodes. The fiftieth anniversary special lived up to the rest of Doctor Who, though I was disappointed that Christopher Eccleston was not in it.Now on Peter Capaldi's run. I feel so so so sorry for Capaldi. It was his lifelong dream to play the Doctor and he was severely let down by the writing. Deep Breath dragged on for more than 75 mins with unnecessary content. Into the Dalek was better but Robots of Sherwood was dismal. Time Heist was an improvement and I quite enjoyed watching The Caretaker. Kill The Moon was absolutely fantastic in the first segment but after the 25 min mark, it turned to absolute bollocks. I thoroughly enjoyed the next two episodes. In The Forest of the Night was like a bad remake of a new Sarah Jane Adventures episode with ignorant characters and the series finale two-parter was better. Season 9 was much better in my opinion overall compared to the season before that. The writing was marginally better. However, I was extremely disappointed by Hell Bent. It was an unforgiving end to Series 9. Season 10 was worse than Season 9, but World Enough and Time shone like a star. Even after all of this complaining, I love Doctor Who with the entirety of my heart. It's a brilliant show with many genres amalgamated into one successfully from 1963 onwards' it offers horror, comedy, mystery, romance and many other elements.

Very much up to date in style and substance, while still paying homage to earlier series with the Tardis etc. and of course the theme music. One can't but feel nostalgia for Doctors William Hartnell and Jon Pertwee who put their own stamp on the character, and were rather senior with more gravitas in characterization than the present reincarnation. However Christopher Eggleston the new Doctor is very much a 21st Century man, cheeky, cheerful, virile, with more than a touch of larrikin that makes him a good foil to his latest girl of the moment, the vivacious Billie Piper as Rose.

9,"It's not surprising that with more than 50 years of adventuring under its belt Doctor Who has featured story lines that many fans choose to pretend never happened. Viewers get caught up in the rich history of the program and then react badly when something happens that contradicts the previously established ""facts"" they've committed to memory.After a while, each fan realizes that Doctor Who is a confusing jumble of events that can't possibly coexist in an internally consistent universe, at least not without a lot of ""time can be rewritten"" nonsense. For a start, there seem to be three Atlantis's and two reasons for the Big Bang, and that's not even counting the accumulating pile of impossibilities that is the revived series.To cope with this madness, fans develop individual ""head canons"", internal universes that only include those stories or even bits of stories that fit in with what they think is proper Doctor Who. When fans decide to toss something out of their head canons, it's not a matter of consigning isolated bad moments to oblivion (there are plenty of those that they resign themselves to accepting), it's more that they think entire stories or ideas are fundamentally misguided and can't fit in with the core concepts of the program they love.One reason a story idea might be unacceptable is that fans judge it's not a direction the program should go in. Alternatively, the execution of an idea might be so bad that fans wish the story had happened differently and promptly start to make up their own much better versions in their heads.Matt Smith getting such a poor swansong story and the Tenth Doctor meeting his end with uncharacteristic cowardice are commonly cited examples of misguided or botched story lines for many fans (while others thought all these choices were fine). But here are 10 even more loathed story lines that were instantly rejected by a large number of fans.Let's start with a very famous change to a central icon of the program that really didn't go down at all well in certain quarters.

,"OK, I don't want to call myself a Doctor who fan, because real Doctor fans watch reconstructions of the lost very first series made from still photos are barely audible sound.But I liked Doctor Who in my youth and like many was happy to know another attempt at bringing the Doctor back was going to be made. Of course I had seen the rather atrocious American Doctor Who movie and I remembered the last episodes of the original series, so I also felt some dread .Now this new series is good, modernised, with the Doctor now wearing leather and supposedly being sexy and of course the beautiful assistant is there.It also updates the ideas and relationship between the Doctor and the Earth. The Doctor is less of a lost blunderer and more of a gen-x adventurer. The plots are now one hour long episodes, and sometimes 2 hour series. The stories are intelligent and funny.That is where it all falls apart, yes the original Doctor Who series is funny...when watched today....but it wasn't back when it was released.

She playing the charter rather then being the charter and having loads of fun with it.As for the writing its a train wreck using time as a excuse for why something suddenly works which is lazy to the extreme.
It then tosses out already established things about the doctor and makes no sense doing so creating a mess.Then there the writing where its so busy preaching to people it forgot its suppose to be fun and entertaining. You can show people things but when you keep hitting them over the head with it then its like those guys knocking on your door wanting you to convert to what every religion it is they are selling.The person in charge shouldn't be running the show he may be a good writer but he in way over his head and things are going badly wrong.",NEGATIVE,0.9977679252624512

I must admit it took a while to get into how peter portrayed the doctor but the episodes just kept getting better the more screen time we got with him.I have my favourite episodes and I think each doctor had some weak episodes but then there's Chris chibnall direction for doctor who and Jodie Whittaker.Jodie could be a great doctor but appears to be ham string by poor writing that instead of writing a good story seems to just use the dr who name as a platform for environmental issues. True I know the show has had messages before that relate to real world issues as does all scifi. My issue is it is done in such a poor way that it isn't even subtle. It just smacks you in the face to the detriment of the stories.It's like they are adding some aliens or sci-fi as an after thought to a recycling story about micro plastics they want to tell.I just really really hate the direction it's gone and there are a few fans still, but the majority of the fan base has packed up and decided to take a break until they either get a new show runner or doctor who gets cancelled... again!Do yourself a favour and watch episodes like blink, girl in the fireplace, waters on mars, silence in the library, hell bent, heaven sent, face the raven, empty child.None of Chris chibnalls episodes can even stand against these masterpieces.

The acting is ok-ish, although the new companions don't get a lot of chance to demonstrate it, but the show is let down by some terrible writing and the need to be so Politically Correct that it can't see beyond the end of its nose.The show began it's latest decline after Jenna Coleman left Peter Capaldi. Bill and Nardol were very average companions to Capaldi's rather average Doctor - although admittedly Tennant and Smith were hard acts to follow.
Then of course the Doctor became female. Absolutely no need for it at all, and no need for all the fuss about it either and it could have worked, but poor Jodie Whittaker has nothing to work with. They writers haven't actually given her a character.Then there is today's Episode 3 - Rosa Parks. Why? Just make a documentary about her and the segregation issues in 1955 USA instead, not have a very boring episode with no jeopardy and a random unexplained bigoted time-travelling non-villain (oh how so very convenient). Then rub everyone's brains into the dust by ending with the Rosa Parks asteroid - was that all the woman was worth? A bloody asteroid!
As a history lesson about Rosa Parks and segregation it didn't work.
As an indication of the racism still prevalent in society today it didn't work.
As an episode of what has been one of the most enduring and loved sci-fi series on British telly it didn't work.

In common with current film makers the makers of the latest series of Doctor Who are trying to conceal a poor story line and script behind a vast amount of increasingly boring CGI, even more so than before and it was bad enough then. They should go back to concentrating on story and use wobbly cardboard sets like in the olden days and dump the CGI effects which no longer have the wow factor they once did. The Doctor now has more dialogue in one episode, usually explaining the plot which indicates that a change of writer is required, than usually found over a whole series, she need to talk a lot less and give us more action. Has any character thought of blinking with one eye at a time to avoid the Weeping Angels moving closer? I managed to watch all the way to the end of ""Flux"" , and it was a struggle, but I'm no wiser regarding the alleged plot than I was at the beginning. Is this very poor effort the death knell for The Doctor? March 2022 Hugh Grant is rumoured to be the new Doctor, if he is he will kill it stone dead never to return. Here we are June 2022 and the casting for the next series has gone Superwoke and no doubt the script will do likewise.

It's looking like she was miscast. Ok, it might be the scripts which is just ludicrously unhelpful but having seen her in other stuff, she tends to play vulnerable types.The other Doctors were dominating characters who you have confidence in they know what they are doing. In this season Jodie's much more passive than she could be. The companions are elevated to semi-equal status which is laughable - it's called Dr Who, not ""Dr Who and some random people off the street"".Thinking back at others, the one person who I think would have been very acceptable as the Dr to the viewing public is John Barrowman - he's got history with the Doctor.I would have thought something like Thandie Newton as Missy and John as the Doc with a more aggressive and dynamic script, far less PC nonsense, more aliens and more bangs and flashes could bring it back.",NEGATIVE,0.9996121525764465

1,"I love Doctor Who. So does my wife and son. And we so wanted to love Jodie Whitaker. I imagine one of the most difficult things for the writers is to produce a unique Doctor with each new regeneration. We thought, with the Doctor becoming a woman, that we were in for one of the most singular Doctors of all time. The possibilities were incredible! Sadly for us, it has been a crash and burn. It's as if the writers are determined to not use the fact of her womanhood at all, except as promotion material. For example, previous Doctors have had so much compassion (Matt Smith especially), but I feel nothing from Jodie. You could plug any guy into the current roll and barely have to rewrite. Her character is so bland. Other than the obvious play of having male characters having a problem with listening to a woman (as tired a story trick as any), there's been very little difference between Jodie and the other Doctors, as far her gender plays. It's tragic. No femininity at all.As for the companions......too many, and I don't care about them. At all. Might as well throw some red jerseys on them. I fell in love with Amy and Rory, Clara, and Martha, almost immediately. 5 episodes into the season, and I cannot even list their names in this review. I'd have to look them up!As far as storytelling goes, the first 5 shows have been standalones without even a hint of an overarching storyline. No crack in the wall, no Bad Wolf, nothing! It feels like you could miss watching the first half of the new season and not only be ok, but not actually have missed anything important!And it feels like there is a political correctness checklist that the writers are working through. For instance, I have never even thought about race or gender before in Doctor Who, but now, every episode, I feel as if political correctness is playing an important role in everything. Story elements seem to be included for the simple correctness of the choice, and that is awful, because Political Correctness ruins pretty much everything it touches, and now it is ruining one of my favorite shows of all time.My last two points are strictly about personal taste, but I have just got to say something about them.Jodie Whitaker's outfit. I have always loved the Doctor's sense of style. Matt Smith (bowties are cool) and Peter Capaldi were so stylish. Jodie Whitaker looks like she fell out of bed and decided to wear whatever she happened to land on. Seriously, she dresses like she could be Mork's cousin from his home planet of Ork. Combat boots and capris along with a ""trench coat"" that looks like it's made from the same material as sweat pants! And let's not forget the suspenders, cause what woman is complete without a pair of suspenders?And finally the phone box. What in the name of all that is good and pure and timey-whymie has happened to the TARDIS!? Seriously, it looks like some child's crystal growing science project went crazy inside the TARDIS. You might even think that the design was something a fan, who has no sense of taste or design, came up with and posted on Pinterest. It's that bad.The only reason I'm going to continue to slog through this atrocity is because I have to know what happens to Clara and Ashildr. The only reason my wife is going to continue watching it is because I am, for the above stated reason. Our son told us to call him if Clara shows up.",NEGATIVE,0.9997730851173401

I can't blame Jodie Whittaker and the other key actors. Even the best actors can't shine through when the stories and the scriptwriting is this bad.

This is all down to the woeful writing/production and a desire to ram political correctness down the throats of those sat at home. The backroom team need to be sacked and Doctor Who reinvented (which shouldn't be difficult given the premise of the show).

1,"[F,64] Watched the first episode as it aired, ardent fan till Colin Baker/Sylvester McCoy who I didn't really take to. As a result never came back until Matt Smith, who I loved. I think it's hard to take to a new Doctor when you really related to the one before, but you *can* adjust if they bring *something* to the role, because it's an expanding character. That's its unique quality in the genre.When I heard about the choice to gender change I was concerned, but after the idea sunk in I thought, yes there's a lot they could do with that. It would take acting talent, and really thoughtful and creative writing, but the idea of this ancient man having to deal with such a radical change in his physical manifestation was rich in possibility, not to mention opportunities for humour. The contrast between the Capaldi form and a female would surely be addressed.But no. Instead of a gender change it was as if there had been a generation change. The Doctor had not transformed into a woman, he had transformed into a child. A child who apparently had forgotten everything that made him who he was. As if he was now a slate that had been wiped clean, leaving only the barest outline of The Doctor - the Tardis, the sonic screwdriver and little else. When she first appeared in Capaldi's costume I thought she looked quite good. Then she picks that romper suit and her whole delivery became more reminiscent of a primary school teacher addressing her class of five-year olds.It's no wonder so many fans are offended. And like many others have said it feels much more like 'fanfic' or kids playing at Doctor Who. And in the end, perhaps that was the intent, to take it back to childhood, to appeal to a younger audience. But here's the thing, only five-year olds at school can tolerate that kind of condescension. And that's only because they're trapped in school. I've been racking my brain to try and imagine the kind of people who are rating this season highly. They can't be Sci-Fi fans. I feel they can't have watched much fiction at all.

To be fair, the first episode deserves about 8 stars, but they should have stopped there. In fact they should have stopped after Christopher Ecclestone left.I would point out that I am a strong believer, albeit none active supporter of Women's rights and equality and therefore have no problem with the casting of a female in the lead. The issue I have is the companions. I am guessing that the writers weren't sure whether to include a female companion as has been the norm, or , as the doctor is now a woman, to have include a male. In my opinion a female would have still suited. But the producers decided on several companions. The result is supplying a script for several actors which in turn has resulted in a weak watered down scripts. This has given us a very flat and uninspiring series, which is a shame because the BBC is capable of much better. For the next series they might consider another actress, because I am not entirely sure Whittaker is a perfect fit, or go back to basics and cast a Male actor, because this is simply not working.",POSITIVE,0.9996238946914673

1,I have watched Doctor Who since 1971 and respect the fact that it has lasted so long but any long lasting franchise is a lot like a Jenga tower in that the longer it goes on the more unstable it becomes because to remain interesting there needs to be storyline twists and reinventions but every time that happens there is a risk that the previous canon becomes null and void.The Timeless Child storyline has caused that to happen. From this point onwards the show can only go downhill unless an entirely new canon is built but then what's the point of that? The show would then become an example of 'Trigger's Broom' which has had 14 new heads and 15 new handles.

And its ironic because when I first heard that there was going to be a female doctor I really wasn't that put off like many old fans were. I thought (naively as it turns out), that as long as they give me good sci-fi stories to experience then I don't exactly care about the Doctors gender. Little did I realise at the time how bad it would get.
It's no longer a sci-fi show...that part seems to be gone forever. Its just become a....you know what? I don't even know any more what the hell it is. Is it a soap opera, a comedy, a social studies lesson? Who the hell knows?
The stories are banal, the scripts terrible, and all the Doctor's companions have one thing in common....they can't act to save their lives. I used to get quite emotionally attached to the Doctors assistants....not anymore. Now I just hope for them all to be killed by a Dalek or turned into Cybermen....anything so I don't have to endure them all for one second longer.

2,"...and it's ALL because of incompetent writers and show runner. Chris Chibnall is a complete disaster.Female Doctor? Fine! Jodi Whittaker had the potential to be as great as Matt Smith or David Tennant - if the script contained reasonable lines for her to say. The Doctor is inconsistent with the nature of the Doctor that has been developed over ALL the past iterations of the Doctor - and that's not okay - nor can it be explained away by the change from Male to Female.Three companions? Seems like a lot - but could be made to work by giving ONE of them a side story each week and have the other 2 assist them with their problem. Chibnall tries to give EACH of them their own story EVERY episode - and they all suck because instead of spending 12 minutes on one companions story - he spends 4 minutes on each companion separately. That wouldn't work with good stories - and Chibnall's stories are NOT good.At this point, I think Series 12 will be the last we see of Doctor Who - and Jodie Whittaker will unfortunately go down as one of the worst Doctor's ever - through no fault of her own.The one chance they have to save this show is to BEG Stephen Moffat to come back for Series 13 - and to help them find a QUALIFIED replacement show runner. If they can get Moffat - I'm sure they can convince the network to renew.One thing is clear though. They need to fire Chibnall IMMEDIATELY - and they need to fire whoever it is that allowed him to remain the show runner and head writer after watching what he did in Series 11.Anyone who tries to blame the Series 11 and 12 poor ratings on Jodie Whittaker or the fact that the Doctor became female - is dishonest  and a lying dog-faced pony soldier.

1,"So a couple of reviews down someone wrote ""This is the best season I've ever seen. Jodie Whittaker is the best actor I've ever seen"". I really don't know what planet this person is on but it's definitely not planet Earth! Like others, I used to love this show! I was all for the Doc being a women and it could have been really good if it was cast right. The fact that Jodie had never even seen 'Doctor Who' before, I find was a really dumb idea because it kinda explains why she runs around like a headless chicken, pulling stupid faces and treating the sonic screwdriver as if it's a magic wand! Next thing is the companions, there's far too many of them! It seems most of them as props for PC and diversity, rather than making the story line more exciting. Tardis = Epic Fail! Storyline is more about pushing PC garbage down your throat, totally boring and unbearable to watch!Once a great show has turned into utter, boring, trash!Just read that Boris is wanting to get rid of the BBC licence, it's about time! Paying to be fed utter trash and forced to listen to completely biased news and all their shows are filled with PC and diversity crap to the point where it's more about the lecture than the actual show! No one likes to be preached to and told how to think, people watch these shows like Doctor Who to get away from all this rubbish and get lost in the whole fantasy world that is not real life!Thumbs down, you've ruined this show, big time!

1,"In wait for the complete season to be available for purchase, I re-saw seasons 1 through 10 and was so looking forward to the intelligent, surreal and challenging Doctor Who episodes. They brought in the right woman for the job. She would have made a good doctor, but the series is not Doctor Who anymore. It's trying so hard to be full of action and wonders, but all the magic is gone. It's so dull that I can hardly get through the season. With each episode, it just becomes more and more depressingly obvious, that the series has taken a turn where no true Doctor Who fan can follow. Nothing is subtle anymore, everything is spelled out and ridiculously politically correct. It's noisy and fast paced and completely lacks the mystery and dark side of the doctor. Doctor Who is now unintelligent main stream entertainment for kids with no depth. I feel sorry for Jodie Whittaker! What should have been maybe the biggest happening of her career and a debut that we were all looking forward to, is turning out that she is the harbinger of the end of the Doctor Who series for us fans.",NEGATIVE,0.7131382822990417
1,"There was always something magical about Doctor Who. Well I thought so. From the moment that I saw my first episode in the sixties I was hooked. It didn't matter that production values reflected its shoestring budget. And the Daleks! I just loved the Daleks. Russell T. Davies and his successor Steven Moffat understood the magic. That's why when the show came back in 2005 a whole new generation of fans jumped on board with us old ones and we all went along for the ride. The extraordinary man in his blue police box was back. What could go wrong?Now after watching all of season 11 I know exactly what can go wrong. Show Runner Chris Chin Balls has ripped the heart and soul out of the show. In trying to appeal to a wider audience he has taken away everything that made the show unique and special - everything that helped it to endure for generations. Unlike in previous seasons the stories are now simple and formulaic with predictable plot outcomes. In a word ( excluding 'Kerblam') they are just boring. In saying that you can see that there has been an obvious attempt to make the stories more character driven rather than plot driven. But it hasn't worked. In the process the character of The Doctor has lost all presence. She comes across as childlike and seems to prefer being part of her 'fam' father than taking control of the situation. And aside from Graham her 'fam' is instantly forgettable.
At first viewing I also found the actors performances to be rather wooden but on reflection I think that this may have more to do with the poor scripts and clunky dialogue. This brings me to the humour. There isn't any. What's Doctor Who without some clever humour.
Mr Chin Balls decision not to include any of Doctor Who's classic monsters in series 11 is also a slap in the face for loyal long time fans of the show. But that doesn't matter any more. This show is now nothing more than a B-grade generic educational sci-fi show for children. After 55 years the magic is gone.
An interesting footnote. I just checked the latest Doctor Who Series 11 UK TV Consolidated Ratings. Episode 1 had a massive 10.96 million viewers but episode 9 only had 6.42 million viewers. A loss of 4.54 million viewers. That is staggering. Obviously after all the advertising, news and hype surrounding a female Doctor had worn off the viewers started to realise just how bad the episodes actually were. Mind you the BBC is still quick to point out that these figures are still an improvement on the previous season. What they fail to mention is the fact that by moving the show from Saturday to Sunday nights they naturally attracted a lot more viewers to begin with. One wonders what their agenda is.",NEGATIVE,0.9991900324821472
1,"This is not Doctor Who.
This is the worst season ever by far.
I agree with the last 10 reviews on almost everything:
bad writing
too much PC - I am absolutely for inclusiveness but not for the sake of it only if it fits and this really looks like they are ticking the boxes. By the way we had lesbians (cant remember whether we had gay men) and Doctor Who obviously fancied some of his female companions but now that the Doctor is a woman is she lesbian now as well?? Not really sure how to take this.
And by the way I am missing ( or is this too extreme for the BBC) and there is no person under 150cm (apart from the Dalek), and most of all NO Asian person! Oh my god is the BBC racist? Sorry about the sarcasm but it is so obvious that they chose the actors for the quota that it hurts. Dont get me wrong I have absolutely nothing against gays or any race and they should be included if it fits or just choose the best actor no matter what he or she looks like?? How about that concept. It is obvious that they did not choose the actors on acting ability. (or maybe its just the very poor script).
I stopped watching after the 3rd episode (I only kept watching in the hope that it gets better, but it got worse..) Now I decided to give it one more try and watched episode 11. What a joke!
This episode is partially reconstructed from previous episodes (Dalek etc) but it is totally boring and unconvincing. First we get bored to death with personal issues of first the couple doing the excavation (and why are there only 2?) then the soapy relationship story with the reappearing dad ( why did he has to come anyway?) and it just goes on and on. If I feel like watching a drama about relationships then I watch a drama and not a scifi series. It felt like they did not know what to write so they put some relationship issues in, but these would need to be developed and progressed and not just thrown in.Then the dalek builds another armor in shed and even manages to build a rocket drive to fly and missiles. This is one crafty farmer who keeps this in his shed. But the end was the worst, how did the Doctor fight the dalek? By talking him out of his wits?
This was totally ridiculous, what a bad writing. This is it for me. I might watch another episode next season, if there ever will be one after this plunder.",NEGATIVE,0.9974461793899536

Everybody is dithering and wailing - until Captain Jack Harkness shows up - and springs her in the blink of an eye.Really?!?!If you are a doctor, you are pretty smart. Doctors are actually known for that. If you are Doctor Who, you are very very very smart indeed, highly innovative and extremely wise, given to pulling endless rabbits out of hats.They can certainly get their own selves out of any prison fast - if the script is so dopey as to put them there first.They are certainly not simply one among clueless equals in The Gang That Cannot Shoot Straight, which seems today's misconceived mode..David Tenant and Matt Smith seriously exuded this essential brilliance. Poor Jodie Whittaker simply does not. She is badly miscast, and this throws a spanner in the companions nexus too.In one of the most remarkable narrative arcs in the history of TV (really dont miss) the Matt Smith doctor for an entire 2 seasons (26 episodes) was resolving the extremely complex puzzlement of Amy Pond.He rebooted THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE to make a certain matter come right.And the equally brilliance-exuding Karen Gillan played Amy Pond. She played one amazing episode almost entirely by herself.The British actress pool is absolutely rife with women who take on roles that make brilliance shine through.Watch Judy Dench playing M. Watch Brenda Blethyn playing Vera. Watch Emily Blunt in Edge Of Tomorrow. Also Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. Emily Watson in Chernobyl. Helen Mirren in Prime Suspect.

The new episodes also seem to focus on shoving a woke political agenda down the audience's throats (there's literally an episode with a political jackass who is meant to represent Donald Trump, and regardless of how you feel about him you have to admit that's low hanging fruit), and Jodie is a terrible doctor. Nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman, she's just not doing a good job. I guess I can't blame her entirely, with the scripts she's given I'm surprised she's still bothering to continue.

The initial run of the series was ruined by John Nathan Turner and ended in 1989. Chris Chibnall is now presiding over the latest demise. The rebooted series was brilliant until Steven Moffat, who presided over the fun and brilliant years of Matt Smith's mercurial portrayal of the beloved timelord, moved on. Since Chibnall took the reigns we have some of the laziest stories and a Doctor we no longer recognize. Once we had a God-like being who terrified all enemies and had his companions in a constant state of awe. Since Moffat left we have a goofball in sunglasses with a guitar and a young woman who is constantly berated by her companions and sheepishly apologizing. Not to mention the weak, inane stories that have no connection to the historical lexicon of the 50 year old series and its incredible legacy. It breaks my heart to see this series die for the second time in my life.

1,"When did Doctor Who stop being Doctor Who?In the original idea for the show the Doctor was a renegade from his own species travelling from society to society and time to time and then during the Pertwee 'Quatermass' years he was a scientist who defended the Earth against alien threats with the assistance of military and government support and then there were the first stirrings of the Time War with 'Genesis of the Daleks' so the Doctor became an asset of his people rather than a renegade and of course much later we had the War Doctor, the Depressed CPTSD Doctor, the Doctor who saved the universe every five minutes and then we get SJW Doctor full of snark and the kind of self righteous indignation that slowly crept into the show from 2005 onwards.The thing is, even as late as 2014 the Doctor stated ""I am an idiot with a box and a screwdriver, passing through, helping out. And I don't need an army, I never have"". But since the latest incarnation a brand new version of the Doctor has turned up and that is the Doctor as literally a God. A founder, a creator, the driving force behind the existence or end of the entire universe and *that* is *utterly* alien to what the Doctor was supposed to be and ever was under all the previous versions and incarnations. Granted, that sort of thing slowly crept in but since the Timeless Child nonsense the Doctor is now a God. Not a renegade or a protector or a servant or an asset or a reluctant warrior or a slightly depressed survivor trying to do what's right like Rick Blaine with a time machine but a literal God.*That* is *not* Doctor Who. *That* is a fantasy of someone who yearns to be ruled by a self righteous all knowing technocrat who, when push comes to shove isn't especially bothered when entire species become extinct.The Doctor in the most recent series is a God and by that I mean a sanctimonious, self righteous, smug and capricious sociopath.In other words a villain. Seriously, what is the difference now between the Doctor and the Master or the Doctor and Rassilon or the Doctor and Omega?The problem with Gods and Masters is that they eventually lose all touch with the reality of the lives of those they rule and begin to see them as insignificant playthings which is all the Doctor seemed to think of the Lupari because when she discovered that they were functionally extinct she could barely manage much more of an emotional reaction than to just say 'Sorry about your species'.That is why Doctor Who is now utterly dead as a franchise.",NEGATIVE,0.9947346448898315

There will always be ups and downs with this series, because it must always be trying new things. Some of Davies' ideas were a bit lame, and Capaldi struggled at first, but it was always worth sticking through the rough spots. This is quite different. It's not just a rough spot. It's not just a little wobbly.
I can understand the thinking behind it - let's shake things up a little, let's freshen it up and give it some new life. Let's look at some actual history, and see what we can learn from it.

5,"Doctor Who has always been my favorite show since I was 7 in 2007. The first 4 series are my favorite (by show-runner Russell. T Davies - RTD) and this is widely regarded as the best of the show by new Who by fans. I could not count how many times i've watched the first few series and they've had such a positive impact on my life. So I can say it practically breaks my heart to see what has happened to the show in recent years (mostly the last two series).I would first like to say that the fact that the Doctor is now a woman and there are a greater number of of minoirty companions/ other characters than ever is not a problem. I also have no issue with the new main actors, they're mostly good actors who try their best but were either badly written or were not suitable for the role. There are a whole host of genuine, non-subjective issues with recent Doctor Who that aren't to do with the identitiy of characters.1) the writingIt's gone so far downhill. Continuity errors, boring stories, badly writen characters, lame villains e.c.t. Most Doctor Who episodes are entirely new stories with a new villain and mystery to solve, with RTD's era even minor characters introduced for one episode were lovable, memorable and developed. Not anymore.2) lack of emotionThe Doctor is supposedly a 2000 year old alien who had seen their entire civilization eradicated, their children and grandchildren killed. They have suffered so much for so long. This was felt in the 4 doctors before Jodie Whittaker's incarnation. Now her version is bubbly and happy and does not feel like the same character. Some of the moments when David Tennant's and Christoper Eccleston's Doctors remebered his previous comapnions, the time war, and those they've lost were some of the most moving parts of the show. In general almost every episode in RTD's era had moments that could move me to tears. For example - rose getting stuck in a parallel world, the Doctor remembering Gallifrey in Gridlock, Madame De Pompador's death and the Master dying in the Doctor's arms. RTD Doctor Who felt like a genuinely deep and emotional show but with aliens and time travel. Now it feels like an action show for kids.3) CompanionsThe New Doctor's companions are literally the first people she met when she fell out the sky. They're not special, they don't stand out or do much to get the Doctor's attention. Every other companion in the show has done something to stand out. Save the world, speak up when others wont, search for the Doctor e.c.t. There also shouldn't be three permanent companions because there isn't enough opportunities to develop them properly and that's clear. Finally, one of the best ways of showing character development is though conflict and resolution. Especially between the Doctor and their companions. But this doesn't happen anymore. They do what the Doctor says without question.4) The MusicSeries 1 - 10 was accompanied with a soundtrack by composer Murray Gold which is outstanding and used beautifully in the show. Honestly it's truly amazing and loved. So much so that multiple orchestra concert tours of the soundtrack have been mega-successful. Unfortunately Murray Gold has stopped making music for Doctor Who. New Who feels empty without a soundtrack.5) Atmosphere change
Honestly, without The Doctor and the TARDIS, if you were to compare an episode from 2005 with an episode from 2018/19 there would be no indication that it was the same show. Everything and I mean everything has changed. All actors gone, effects massively changed, writing, choregraphy, editing, tone e.c.t. change can be good but not when everything you love about a show is removed and replaced.6) Less careBack in 2005 -2010, there was less of a budget and the show was newer. That meant the producers had to rely on better storytelling, characters and acting over visual effects and they needed to make an impression on fans. Some of the best episodes ever have less action and grand effects e.g. Midnight and Blink. Now, 15 years later, it doesn't matter what tosh gets put on air, people will watch it because people love Doctor Who. Fortunately people are even starting to see through this as last series (12) had the least amount of viewers of any series yet. It doesn't matter if the cgi is great or full of action, if the story is rubbish, why should people care?7) ActorsAlthough the main cast of the last two series aren't bad actors, they're not brilliant either. They do not bring the same raw emotion that the earlier cast did. That and some of the acting of minor one-episode characters in recent years has been genuinely awful. As i've mentioned, RTD's era had good minor characters. Very well acted too.8) Timeless ChildThe finale of season 12 was a massive mistake that completely needlessly changed who the Doctor is. Essentially the Doctor is an alien with the power to regenrate - change into a new body when gravely injured. It was always a fact that they are a member of a species that can do this. They're not unique. Now apparently they're a god like being (timeless child) that was the first to regenrate ever and was tortured so others can regenrate. They are the origin of their own species. Sure it's a big twist but it's terrible. Writers need to learn that big twists and subverting expectations are bad if they're just for shock and don't make sense (like the end of Game of Thrones). The entire show for 57 years has been built on the fact that the Doctor is not special, they just ran away and as a character they've grown and improved and want to help. They have become special with all the lives they've touched and saved. Now apparently they're special because they are born special. What a bad message. Also them being the Timeless Child means they're immortal and always have and will be but they never knew. This will take away all the danger from future episodes. It also means that all the times they've risked their lives to save others or others have died to save them are meaningless. It's insulting.~In short, although i've ripped into the last two series, Doctor Who starts off amazing and I would 100% recommend it. I would never not want to watch it, knowing what goes wrong later on. I really hope it changes for the better because i've given up on it for now.",NEGATIVE,0.9997250437736511

1,"I don't understand exactly why the original Doctor Who works so well - it's cheap, quirky, violent, and silly, yet somehow all its lurid elements work together perfectly to produce a masterpiece of pop culture. Despite having so much going against it, old Who is simply the best and most thoughtful science fiction series of all time, and I've found that it holds up well when shown to new viewers (provided they're reasonably smart and open-minded people, that is).New Who, on the other hand, is a shallow crowd-pleaser without a whiff of the original series' integrity or intelligence. It's Doctor Who, yes, only with deliberate camp instead of charm and sarcasm instead of brains. And, whereas the original series was a generalized attack on fascism and intolerance, this new one attempts more specific commentary on issues of the day that always feels grafted-on and poorly thought out. Imagine something as cheesy as the Adam West Batman, only burdened with angry attacks on FOX News and the War on Terror, and you're close to imagining what this bizarre and bitter revival is like.Christopher Eccleston plays a character called the Doctor, but in truth he bears little resemblance to that hero of old. A dramatic actor by habit, Eccleston is clearly at sea when trying to play an alien, and he overacts horribly to compensate for this awkwardness. He grins, he gloats, he prances around like a gawky oddball. It's a terrible performance, and I'm not surprised that he left the show after one season. He belongs elsewhere.Billie Piper fares somewhat better as the Doctor's companion Rose, but in truth she's a fairly useless character. She rarely has much to do with the resolution of the episodes, unless the writers contrive an outrageous way for her to defeat the villain (one such lazy writers' device grants her godlike powers for no discernible reason). Piper's a likable performer, but the character isn't likable, and the sideline plot involving her domestic life drags on interminably.Things happen in this Doctor Who not because they make sense, but because they're ""cool."" The Doctor can summon the TARDIS by sticking its key into thin air; the TARDIS can dispense tremendous powers at will; the Doctor can phase through whirling blades by closing his eyes and concentrating really hard; the sonic screwdriver is suddenly powerful enough to do anything and resolve any problem. One character is dumb enough to decloak and light up his invisible spaceship in the middle of the Blitz. Why? Because it's a neat image, that's why. There's no logic here, not even the made-up logic of most science fiction.Speaking of sci-fi, it's practically absent here. There are no interesting science-based concepts in this series; in fact, there aren't even any alien planets, which is inexcusable in a show that's ostensibly about space exploration. Lead writer Russell T. Davies has admitted that he has no interest in ""hard"" sci-fi, and he thinks that it's dull to general audiences; while he may have a point, he was wrong to siphon out ALL of the sci-fi from this series. Once it's gone, all that remains is ludicrous high fantasy without any grounding in reality whatsoever.The show is entertaining enough, I must admit, but on a fundamental level it doesn't work. Its cranky assaults on the media, the government, and the complacent TV-viewing public come across as thin and preachy. The tone's all wrong, too; can you really mix serious politics with toilet humor and endless sexual innuendo? It's just a mess of clashing concepts, poorly executed, with the show's fantasy format used as an excuse for the writers' foolish ""anything goes"" attitude.Sorry, folks, but this is a disgrace. It's still cheesy, too; the bad models and rubber aliens of the original series have been replaced by mediocre CGI and boring, money-saving Earthbound locations. Perhaps the second season will be an improvement, but so long as head writer Davies is around to churn out campy, dirty, silly, angry episodes, I don't think we'll see much of an improvement. Don't believe it if you read some hipster newspaper columnist declare this the greatest Who of all time; the original series was usually better than this, and even on a bad day, it was less condescending to viewers and far less irksome.I know Doctor Who.

Until seasons 11 and 12 of the reboot when the wokeness of the last 5 seasons finally took over the entire show.
This show has now become a series of leftist talking points. It is no longer entertaining at all, and the current incarnation of the Doctor is of someone who is less intelligent than an average human being.
This is meant to be possibly the most intelligent and wise being in the universe.. and JW plays it as if she had received a lobotomy. It is utterly ridiculous as are pretty much all the plotlines throughout season 11 and what I have seen of season 12.
Every single episode is simply a chance for the writers to lecture on their disgusting moral theories. It is utterly ridiculous and I have had enough of random eulogising about things they simply don't understand.Well done BBC you have taken a truly legendary franchise and made it such that I long for the days of Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor and the almost zero budget associated with those seasons.

2,"I have seen every available episode of Doctor Who starting with ""Unearthly Child"" in 1963. I have seen how the writers have affected the quality of the show. How the special effects affected the show in terms of viewership.Doctor Who has always been know for its cheesy special effects, most notably in the 1980's episodes. Most people will forgive the cheesy effects as long as the writing is good. Doctor Who was all ways at its best when all the characters were flushed out, when we, the audience knew the characters. This is especially true for the Doctor and his companions. I can understand why so many people are upset with the current run of Doctor Who. So far, there has been no real reason to care for the Doctor or her companions other than the fact that it's the Doctor and her companions. I can not see why the Doctor being a women is so important to the current series. that fact that the Doctor is a women does not advance the storyline. It seems the only reason the Doctor is a women now is for the BBC to make up some past social injustice. And that is the same for the Doctor's current companions.As far as writing goes, the characters are all flat, 2 dimensional. Why do I need to care if someone is gay? Why is it important that someone is Indian? The writers are spending too much time bring up character points that should be trivial. For example, the character of ""Martha"". She was black. So what of it. It was never the focus of the character. The fact that ""Martha"" was black was trivial. It DID NOT define her as a character. The current series is making too much of a character sexual orientation or race. The current writers have fallen in to this mistake. It's like soap opera writers are writing for Doctor Who now.The Last two years of Doctor Who has become shallow and uninteresting. This is exactly what happened to Doctor Who in the late 1980's. This is what killed Doctor Who as a show in 1989.I fear if the BBC continues with Doctor Who as is, in its current state, Doctor Who will be canceled indefinitely.Jodie Whittaker I'll be forever be known as ""The actor that killed Doctor Who"".If the BBC, changes course and fixes Doctor Who. Then Jodie Whittaker will be forever known as the ""Doctor we wish never was"".Someone needs to point out to the BBC that ever time they interjected social justice in to a Doctor Who franchise, the series never lasted more that 4 years.

I just got thru watching the last episode, ""Resolution"", and there were holes in the logic big enough to drive a car through. And I don't think Chibnall's ever watched an old episode of Doctor Who.

Don't expect from this show to be realistic. It can be serious, but often it is a lot of action with comedy. Interesting characters, so many unique environments and technology. With Capaldi (and with a new companion) the series started to go down. Unopposed anti-men rhetoric was getting in more and more. The doctor character started feeling off, because in previous incarnations he was quick to spot and judge bigots, not this time. After seeing trailers with the new female doctor, the show died for me. Sorry, I am not watching propaganda in my time reserved for entertainment. If you want politics in show, sure, I don't have a problem with that, I loved Star Trek: The Next Generation after all.

I have always looked forward to watching every episode.However they definitely dropped the ball with Capaldi, not that he is a bad actor, but they rammed SJW agendas down your throat. So much so, that many episodes were basically unwatchable.Rather than get better writers they have decided to throw the entire essence and character out the window and replace it with a woman!!! Why on earth would you make such a bad decision. Don't get me wrong, I was a big fan of Broadchurch, great show, and Jodi was perfect in that role, as she is a very talented actor.It's just that I have always looked up to the doctor as a role model since I was a kid. He was my hero and now he is gone. And I don't resist change....I just love my hero!! Nothing wrong with that.Episode 1 I am forced to watch a women, carrying a phallic shaped sonic screwdriver, with a rainbow LGBT gender neutral T-shirt, who judgmentally rolls her eyes at the nerdy white guy (yeah I noticed it) who wants to leave the train in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and seems to give up hope in the second episode towards the end (something that the doctor would never ever do...as the Doctor has always been the bastion of hope even when all hope was gone). Episode 3 = save the repressed African Americans from the evil racist white people. Episode 4 = Parody of Trump, but.....I'm not from America. I d o n ' t c a r e.Oh please. No....

3,"For me, Seasons 1 to 6 were a revelation. Doctor Who was back and in superb form with engaging stories and great characters. I was well and truly hooked and supported the view that this was up there with the best in TV viewing.Season 7 took a noticeable downturn with the utter drivel of 'The Rings of Akhaten' providing a foretaste of what was to come. The gushing 'love conquers everything' theme was dangerously close to producing projectile vomiting. It appeared that the PC brigade were starting dominate the scripts and they clearly thought that the viewers needed to be front-loaded with this nonsense.Season 10 appears to be the culmination of this twaddle superseding the need for excellent storytelling. Take 'Thin Ice' as an example. On the plus side they got the British infantry uniform of 1814 correct complete with the Belgic Shako which had only been introduced a couple of years earlier, although they did get the Union Flag wrong. Having taken the trouble to get the set looking something like 1814 London they then filled the characters and extras from every ethnic background you can possibly think of. You could almost see the BBC bod in the background ticking off the diversity check list. It not only insults the intelligence of the viewer it detracts from the story. Which in this case was pretty poor anyway.During the course of this season we have had adverse references to Donald Trump, a stereotypical and one-dimensional view of the British Empire, an implication that racism is the number one problem facing the human race, and a companion who has reminded us in every episode that she is a lesbian. Added to this is a noticeable drop in the quality of scripts, repeatedly poor use of CGI, and the loss of Murray Gold has lead to a decline of the quality of music that so enhanced the atmosphere of earlier seasons.The final 2 episodes were an improvement but overall I get the sense that Doctor Who is sliding back into oblivion. The reboot may offer an opportunity to recover its excellence but given the prevailing attitudes within the BBC I am not holding my breath. A starting point would be avoid politics and tone down the Political Correctness.

And perhaps that's merely sign of the current zeitgeist, of who we are as a culture.It saddens me to say this, but it appears I am no longer the target audience.

5,"I've discovered Doctor Who with the reboot in 2005. It was cheesy and not very good (with a few good episodes) but there were some good ideas and concepts so I followed two seasons. Both the Doctor and its companion were interesting enough.Waiting for season 3 I bought the old series DVD boxes. Honestly : a bit hard to watch, but historically interesting (to see how the writers minds worked at the time.)Then season 3 happened. It got from not very good to bad : bar a few good episodes, it was unwatchable (I loathed most of the ""Davies""). Childish plots with all the holes you don't want, childish adults, stupid peoples to make the story happen.It got gradually worse until the Doctor's face changed again, along with the head writer.I mostly liked the Matt Smith seasons. There was some kind of rhythm, of magic, in it at the start. The right kind of silly. The quality raised again with quite a few good stories. It was better than the first two seasons and the companion was interesting again. (Not to mention : impossibly beautiful). Granted, some episodes were just awful, but I tend to forget them. (Which shows how a bad run can lower your expectations). Then the Doctor face changed again.With this change, for some reason, the plot got back to childish, uninspired and full of holes. We are back on a ""it happens because everyone is stupid"" case.Although Capaldi has a great face and eyes for the role, the new Doctor persona that has been given to him is of a headless chicken with two hearts. Seeing him fighting like a child with ""Robin Hood"" ... that was the last drop.And to add insult to injury : what about firing a golden arrow* to a ship taking off because ... it lacks gold ... in the making of the engine ... ? There is suspension of disbelief, and then there is moronic. And all these heavy gold plates* they were holding before would not have helped because ? And didn't the doctor said before all this it could not work because the ship was too damaged and it would just explode ? Hoy, it was late and I was sleepy but I was not dead. A dead brain is what you need to accept this utter nonsense.One would though there is nothing left to ruin, but they managed to surprise me by adding some nauseating irrelevant honey at the end.I'm now convinced they are only targeting children, even if they are only suited for the 1 to 4**, definitively losing all the adults.I don't care about silliness, about weird cheap-looking gizmos. This is science-fiction, I can accept a set of rules, this can be fun. But I cannot bear to watch weak stupid plots that can only happen if nobody exist or act when not on camera***, if the characters are morons and if it only barely make sense when you consistently ignore what has been said 10 minutes before.They sometimes use french words. Here is one for the summary:Pitoyable(*) Do you have any idea of how heavy gold really is ? That arrow probably weighted 5 to 10 kilos. The plates 10 times more. But that's OK because this misconception is so common in TV and movies. (Fun fact: all the gold refined through history would take a cube with a side of 20 meters.)(**) At 4 children can pass the Sally-Anne test. They would not be so easily fooled by this nonsense anymore.(***) You know, that typical story crime ? Like when you have a guy alone killing a platoon one by one with all the other soldiers magically forgetting they have a weapon until they are on screen and it's their turn to die.",NEGATIVE,0.789875864982605

Honestly the shows been drawn out enough, it could have been left nicely and satisfyingly with Peter kapaldi. Seriously, I can't even tell I'm watching doctor who. If I walked in halfway through an episode I would never know that this is doctor who. Compare that with literally any other doctor who episode from any other season, you could jump into an episode at any point and you know instantly that you're watching doctor who. The nostalgia is lost. The storyline doesn't even make much sense anymore. It's taking the piss. 12 lives- that had been established from the beginning. Obviously the producers main aim is to milk this for as long as possible. But this season is going to devalue doctor who in general. People will stop watching.

This last season though, was anything but and failed in almost every regard aside from technical.
With the second season about to begin I'll give it one more try but the first episode better be a corker.
I know the original purpose of the Doctor series was to act as an incubator for off camera talent within the BBC but at least the juniors had direction and some training.
This latest offering seems to have been thrown to the work experience kids who are then left to their own devices.

And here's how it happened: Nepotism.The Broadchurch connection eliminated any real casting for the lead role and so we end up with the weakest doctor ever. She is a terrible doctor and, upon, announcement I suspected she would be. The problem is, unfortunately, that Ms Whittaker isn't a character actor. That's not a huge criticism in general but it is if you're playing the iconic Doctor. Jodie is just Jodie in whatever she does. She makes for a ridiculous Doctor in that absurd outfit.Forcing a female doctor was always going to be a challenge. The last thing you'd want to do is the first thing Chibnall did: pick a friend. Maybe the BBC couldn't afford Tilda Swinton but you can't tell me that all those (pointless) auditions didn't turn up someone with an ounce of talent for the role. I just cannot believe how utterly terrible Ms Whittaker is as an actor in this role and cannot fathom how Chibnall can get away with this. The nepotism (which goes beyond Ms Whittaker) is well documented. Come on.. is the world really that small?There's no point even commenting on the rest of the cast and the plots.

Because the overall storyline always left this door open, we knew all along that it was completely possible to have a doctor regenerate into a female body, it's not a plothole or anything. We even had Missy / Master and Michelle Gomez blessed us with a brilliant performance. So everything I'm about to say has nothing to do with the doctor being female. And if, then only because they ruined the one thing I've been so excited about - a female doctor - with the mess they've created.Episode after episode, it got worse. One of the first things that I noticed bothering me was the chaos and lack of established relationships created by traveling with three companions. Yes, we've seen episodes before where the doctor traveled with more than one person. But it you think of Amy and Rory, the Doctor had an already established relationship with Amy, there was this slight tension between Rory and the Doctor that made it even more interesting, and they made something so special about this trio. With our current companions, it's just obscure dialogue, at times so loaded with politics that I wonder if I'm even watching a Science Fiction show anymore. 11.04 was such a low point already that I just wanted to give up.
The overall lack of anything that aligns with the Doctor Who we love is another big failure. The only thing they tried to establish was quirkiness. But what for? Yes, we had a quirky Doctor before. Matt Smith did that perfectly, because we came to learn that his oftentimes childish behavior, his quirks were simply masking the pain that the war has inflicted in him. Something that was carried out so well and was perfectly summed up in the conversation Clara has with Madame Vastra after the Smith / Capaldi regeneration. Whittaker on the other hand took on these quirks to be Doctor-like, when it wasn't really necessary. Last but not least, the episode were boring. Plain and simple.

I had presumed that because of the heavy competition such as the Star Trek trilogies the new Dr Who would at the very least be science interesting. I knew the budgets wouldn't be on the level of the US sci if shows so surely the makers would rely heavily on the script and the strong actingHow wrong was I..From the very first second of the very first episode I had a bad feeling.

The latest script and acting are so appalling everyone involved in making this rubbish should be ashamed that they are taking British licence fee payers money. Its such a disgrace I believe the BBC should issue a public apology and refund everyone in the UK a portion of their TV tax back.

Her ""Im one of the lads"" attitude is in your face constantly and you had better believe within a few episodes she will be running around with a pint of lager in her hand in every episode. Also mark my words, this sidekick will save the Doctor and the Universe on her own much more than all the others put together quite simply because shes a woman and we need it rammed down our throats constantly that women can do anything better than any man, especially in Britain.

And IF the BBC were a private company that would be acceptable..but they're not they have a formal Charter which forbids this!Meanwhile, let's try and disguise what the returning showrunner is doing by temporarily bringing back a familiar lead character to 'transition' the message, then get back on-message, once the storm of the previous job holder has blown over...and remember this is supposed to be a young teenage sci-fi show folks!

1,"In order to understand why this all-new, all-digital Doctor Who is anything but, one must consider what made the original series such a classic, and why it eventually went off the air. Beginning all those years ago in 1963, the original aim of Doctor Who was to create an educational show for children in which various historical periods were visited first-hand. All set within a science fiction framework, of course. But when the second serial detoured to a planet of the future and presented a certain creature called a Dalek, the entire series' focus changed, and the result remained on the air in some form for twenty-six great years. The problem was that as television changed, becoming more sophisticated and cynical, Doctor Who came under the control of a producer dedicated both to modernising the series as well as keeping it under budget. As his reign over the program continued, the quality of the scripts, production methods, and even some of the actors diminished. This is especially clear in the last few seasons, where serials were cut down to three parts in spite of how little sense they often made as a result.So when the BBC announced that it was bringing Doctor Who back to the air in 2005, anticipation was mixed with a very real fear. Would the modernisation go so far as to destroy everything that made the Doctor the Doctor? The unfortunate answer in this case is a big yes, and I submit that anyone who grew up watching the real Doctor Who and has sufficient writing skill to complete a novel could write a better quality story than most of those offered here. Admittedly, I have seen the new episodes in a fragmented, disjointed manner due to the poor scheduling by the local broadcaster, but each episode contains a myriad of flaws that the real Doctor Who overcame in spite of having a budget of around sixpence per episode. The biggest problem begins with the special effects, or the total lack of them in the real thing. When the Doctor was at his best, the episodes focused on the growth of the characters accompanying the Doctor on his journeys, as events both amazing and terrible unfolded around them. There was a real story with real character development.As a typical example of where this new pseudo-Doctor ruins it, one episode involves the Doctor bringing two companions with him to a planet and time where a port-like device can be grafted into one's head. All the autoimmune complications aside, the episode (gone too are the multi-part serials that allow a story room to breathe) ends with one companion having had such a device implanted. The Doctor, dismayed at seriously trangressive behaviour by this individual, leaves him in what I presumed to be present-day Earth, still with the implant in, and said implant still set to open up at the sound of clicking fingers. The episode ends with the companion's mother getting a shock when she does exactly that in front of him. Given that this technology does not exist in present-day England, and probably will not for at least a century, leaving this man there makes a drastic alteration to the history and destiny of the Earth. In case you are failing to get this, allow me to emphasise: it would never cross the mind of the real Doctor to do this.Another shot that comes to mind when trying to describe how the BBC has tried to improve Doctor Who and instead had the exact opposite effect involves the classic Daleks. Without this nemesis, it is very likely that the series would not have lasted a fraction of the forty years it has been in television, novel, or audio format. But jokes about their terrible design have also been abundant. As the late Jon Pertwee put it, one only had to run up a flight of stairs and they were in a bind. 1980s producer John-Nathan Turner responded to this by producing a script in which the seventh Doctor did exactly this, only to find the Daleks had added anti-gravity devices to their shells. Aside from the use of a special effect that looked even cheaper than it was, it took audiences by surprise, as did many of the episodes shown in that season. The end of one new episode involving Daleks involves a surprise, but not of the positive kind. Imagine Daleks floating down from a ramp some fifty feet above their landing point, with no obvious hint as to how they do this, in total defiance of the laws of physics.Thus, the most fundamental rule that kept the Doctor on-air for so long is broken. One of the Doctor's most memorable lines is to his own daughter, telling her to go forward in her beliefs, and prove to him that he is not mistaken in his. This display of absolute faith in the ability of a character in spite of great youth is still a stark contrast to most television (and society in general) of the times, as well as an affirmation of the fact that intelligence will open many a door that brute force cannot touch. This new pseudo-Doctor Who, on the other hand, is analogous to modern commercial television in that it believes its audience to be stupid enough to believe anything. And thus, everything that this imitation turns out to be is a spit in the face of everything that the series originally stood for. Sure, it looks pretty and the quality of the source materials is such that it will not require laborious restoration to present on home video, but strip away the hood and you have less than nothing.Hence, I gave this thing they are trying to call Doctor Who a one out of ten. Even the worst serials of the John Nathan-Turner era had more to them than this.",NEGATIVE,0.9998064637184143

OK, so I admit the idea is pretty good - a futuristic space titanic - but seriously it was such a disappointment. David Tennant was average as the doctor and Kylie Minogue was very mediocre. the script was poor the special effects weren't great and all in all it was very dull.I remain baffled at the great reviews and the laughable 8.8 rating on IMDb.

Wasn't fond of Colin Baker or Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor in their eras, but their stories are Shakespearean perfection compared to the dumpster fire that was the entire last season, and the abysmal piece of trash that I wasted an hour watching this past Sunday (Orphan 55). Spyfall (parts 1 &2) were actually pretty decent and made me hopeful that last season's PC preachiness was over (thus the extra star), but the overall trend is looking like the plane in Spyfall: cockpit blown out and passengers freaking out as they prepare for crash landing. Was Chibnall giving us an allegory of his plans for the show? Because that's what he's doing. The last 20 seconds of Orphan 55 was like being in a Pentecostal meeting altar call.

2,"Rose  Does anything actually happen in this episode? It introduces our two leads, a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly un-interesting companion. There's no plot to speak of, childish humour, mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music. What else is there to say, really?The End of the World  A marginal improvement, in that we see our first outer-space scenario. Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour, paper-thin logic, very poor pacing, and tired SF clichés.The Unquiet Dead  Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write interesting character dialogue, AND integrate an intriguing plot. Let down solely by the Doctor and Rose.Aliens of London/World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity, trying her best in dire circumstances. Some poorly written, and out-of-place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes, and a return to poor pacing, bad plotting and cringe worthy humour/satire.Dalek  Not great, however still far above the RTD fare to date. The pacing and script are all fine (though the Doctor and Rose still irritate). The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well. The finale, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most notorious foe, into a cuddly touchy-feely mess, and turning a previously un-seen menace, to a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy.The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was in a clichéd 80s style. Still, it was marred somewhat by his usual over-reliance on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to make logical sense, and again poor pacing. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but instantly forgettable.Father's Day  The initial premise could've been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning. Also, we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking this is all about characterization, remember, there's a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization. On the plus side, it does prove RTD isn't the worst script writer so far.The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way, with some cringe worthy moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make (Well lit windows in a blackout, anyone?). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes, showing us what an interesting companion could've been like. She could also act. Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a little hasty, but sufficient. The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I had been so disillusioned by the current series, that upon seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode, I gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture.Bad Wolf - Reality TV, arguably the worst facet of the modern media, is basically used as the premise. There's no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. This in an RTD episode, so they're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows. Once again, logic goes out the window, as we're placed 200,000-something years in the future. RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some 'over-arcing' story here, with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end... They make empty threats, and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster paced for the most part, than RTD's other efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another lacklustre instalment.The Parting of the Ways - The big finale. More of a damp squid, literally. All of the Dalek menace set up in 'Dalek' is brought crashing down, as they become rather pathetic. So many plot holes riddle this episode, with typically poor contrivances. Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks, but then vaporize entire continents? Dalek's can vaporize said continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people so they can be saved in it? This ability can't be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god'? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but don't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside, we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived, joined with a near pointless story arc.So what can we say about the new series, all-in-all?Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable, if they were anything other than Doctor Who, and had RTD's name attached? I think not.Some people would have us think we can't say anything against RTD, since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a poorly planned, ill conceived product, churned out at that price. I'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort. For the most part, this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name, marring what is otherwise the most creative genre.",NEGATIVE,0.9990481734275818

They've taken away all the fun, fear, silliness, sadness and heartfelt moments and replaced them with dry, cardboard hallmark TV moments. The only thing saving this season is the cinematography and music. The writing is atrocious, the acting is abismal and there is no storyline. Nothing to keep you watching, wanting to know what happens next, hooking you in, making you crave more. It's just so bland and boring and trying so hard make it PC, to try to please everyone, by trying not to offend anyone that they've just broken the whole show. Jodi Whitaker is a decent Doctor... well, she would be if given a chance. I really hope they don't cancel Doctor Who, because it is such a wonderful and inspirational program, but, they tried too hard this season and just failed.

None of the jokes are funny and it seems more like a really bad PBS show that's trying to educate history in a ""hip"" manner. I don't know if it's bad acting or just that the new Doctor character itself is so badly setup, but Jodie's version of the Doctor seems so artificial that none of her threats to protect or fight feel genuine at all.

3,"The last 3 years of Doctor Who have been for me a great disappointment. It seems the BBC has increased the budget for special effects but cut corners and cut cost on the writing. The current Doctor and companions have no depth. If I had to guess, I would say Jodie Whittaker never seen an episode of Doctor Who before. It's like someone described Doctor Who to someone else who never heard of Doctor Who before and that person tried to describe Doctor Who to a third person and that third person described Doctor Who to Jodie Whittaker. I don't think any of the current writers ever wrote for Doctor who before until just recently. I have been following Doctor Who ever since the original series from 1962. I know every actor that took the role of the Doctor since William Hartnell was told to make the Doctor their own. Some actor were better at it than others. Jodie Whittaker just doesn't seem to translate the Doctor very well in the series. I don't care if the Doctor is a man or a women, as long as they make me believe they are the Doctor. Jodie Whittaker just isn't doing for me. Honestly, I'm wishing I have never seen Jodie Whittaker's Doctor Who.
As for the companions. They're to many of them. It makes the episodes needless and complicatedly uninteresting. Why is so much attention from the writers being paid to a companion's race or if they are gay? Who cares? It does nothing to advance the story. It makes the characters very one dimensional.In summary, the 2017-present series of Doctor Who just isn't the same anymore. It has lost its spark. It's lost me as a viewer. I believe Doctor Who is on its way to being canceled again. What a shame.",NEGATIVE,0.9949058294296265
3,"Nowadays, the original version of Doctor Who (1963-89) is often mocked for its bad special effects, allegedly slow pacing and lack of popularity...even though it was popular, for most of its run.However, the new version of Doctor Who (2005-??) tends to get a free pass for its goofy soap opera dramatics, shallow ""arc"" plots, lame CGI and dumbing down of the Doctor's character. Well, I know one cranky Internet review will hardly tip the critical balance in favor of Old Who, but I'm gonna contribute my two cents on the subject anyway.In case you haven't guessed it, I LOVE classic Who. When I was a child, the original series intrigued and amused me, got me interested in history, and gave me a great intellectual/heroic role model in the Doctor. Certainly, the show lost some steam (and ratings) over the years, but it actually made a nice recovery in its final, flawed-but-fascinating seasons.Since 2005, I've followed this revived version of Doctor Who, and basically hated every second of it. I fundamentally disagree with the new show runners, who focus all of their storytelling efforts on the Doctor's young human companions. They've literally dragged a once high-concept show ""down to Earth,"" emphasizing tedious plot elements like shallow romances, family dynamics, and the companions' boring jobs. Sue me, but I liked the show better when it was primarily about the Doctor - the magical character. The interesting one. Not the mere mortal.Indeed, all of the sci-fi elements in New Who are just window dressing. For example, the Doctor's sonic screwdriver can now solve all of his problems, because the new writers don't know anything about real science and need an easy gimmick to get out of tough spots. Also, the Doctor hardly ever visits alien planets any more, and when he does, he rarely encounters an interesting or well-developed alien culture. Alas, these far-off worlds end up being mere CGI backdrops for the latest round of arguing and flirting between the Doc and his companion. And how about those new villains? In the original series, the Daleks represented the Nazis, while the Cybermen reflected our anxieties about technology taking over our lives. But what do the mighty Weeping Angels represent? They're...um...creepy statues that freak you out. A nice image, but a totally hollow idea. That's why they were only good for their first two appearances. And don't get me started on the Slitheen, who combined flatulence with far-out 9/11 conspiracy theories. (Does anyone else miss Roger Delgado?)Now, many of New Who's defenders say that it represents a more emotional, human take on the concept than Classic Who. But I don't think the emotions represented here are genuine. Characters in New Who are largely shallow and dumb. They fall in and out of love and lust, seemingly at random. (For example: Amy suddenly hating Rory in ""Asylum of the Daleks."" I bet he regretted that whole Lone Centurion thing!) And when characters die, they are often resurrected by the power of LOVE, combined with sci-fi nonsense. Geez, pass me the air sick bag.Speaking of death, it isn't handled very seriously in New Who. In the classic series, death was violent and final. This hammered home the human cost of fighting evil forces like the Daleks. In New Who, characters tend to get brought back to life by pixie dust. Or, the violent deaths are hardly shown. It's such a toothless re-imagining of the whole concept.Of course, I'm in the minority here. Longtime Who fans like Steven Moffat and Gareth Roberts are the ones writing this stuff, and claiming that it's faithful to the spirit of the original series. But it isn't. It's sold out to get higher ratings. So we'll never see a really smart episode, like Kinda or The Aztecs or Ghost Light again. But we will see nonsense like dinosaurs coughing up the TARDIS, Rose becoming a goddess by looking into the heart of the TARDIS, and the Doctor saying ""bow ties are cool"" several hundred times. Goodbye intelligent writing, hello stupid catchphrases.Thankfully, the show's production team changes so often that there's always hope it will get better. But as of October 2014, we have a great Doctor in Peter Capaldi who is being badly served by lame scripts. Even when they get one element right in New Who, there's about 15 other elements they have wrong.",NEGATIVE,0.9910476803779602

S12E03 had so much hope as a concept and the monsters are genuinely great but it was butchered completely. I just kept thinking about what a fantastic episode it would be with the 10th Doctor and written by Moffat instead. Clearly the mix of director, writers and actors is just not working at all somewhere and needs to be scrapped immediately. The fact that 9/10 reviews on here are a one star could not make it any clearer.
Are the BBC just ignoring all their viewers for some reason?
I do want to mention as well that I am SO for a female doctor, it could be exactly what doctor who needs for a breath of fresh air now that its a decade+ into the revival but Jodie Whittaker and the group is not it at all.
Also inclusivity is great and having a diverse cast is great, and that has nothing to do with the failure of the last series (and presumably this one too).

If we wanted Fantasy Magic there are numerous shows to watch; just like the Zombie Genre.From 2005 to 2010 Dr. Who is Sci Fi and the stories are written for grown ups. Dr. Who with Moffat's influence doesn't acknowledge the suspension of disbelief premise and just dives into stupidity.

2,"Have been a fan of Doctor Who since the reboot in 2005. Christopher Ecclestone, David Tennant and Matt Smith were excellent Doctors with superb stories and excellent supporting cast. Things started to go downhill with Peter Capaldi but it was still watchable. Since Jodie Whittaker took over in 2018 almost every episode has been preaching moral issues and social (in)justice, which is all well and good but it makes for very boring entertainment which is what the show is supposed to be. The show also suffers from very poor character development. The Doctor now has three assistants, none of which adds anything of value to the show as no investment of backstory has been put into them. Also, the stories are so hideously complex it is difficult to understand what is supposed to be going on (the actors don't seem to either). Too much is crammed into 50 minutes to grasp what is happening.
The main problem however is that Whittaker seems uninterested in the stories that she is acting in, she may be a good actress but she is not good in this, as her version of the Doctor is so dull although this could be due to the poor writing and direction.Doctor Who needs to change quickly or it risks damaging the legacy it has built up over the years.",POSITIVE,0.8160741925239563

Actually that IS a change. Is it a MESSAGE?

Is Jack the Doc's ex?)After a couple of adventures with Rose, a late teen child of a one parent family, Doctor Eccleston was off and Doctor David Tennant abseiled in. Suddenly the series became obsessed with Rose's family life.She and Doctor David travelled to a PARALLEL UNIVERSE ( not that rotten old cliché,I hear you cry!) where her Mother and Father are a couple but there's no Rose.Then Rose's mother dies and.... Yes, I guessed what would happen in the final episode very early on. Notice I haven't talked about the Doctor's adventures. The reason being that series 2 was really about Rose's family affairs-predictable incident succeeded predictable incident until the predictable family reunion. Yawn Yawn.

There weren't that many agendas, they had true humor, we expanded, nearly every episode added something new, and all in all it was very fun to watch. Then something happened.

My favourite was Jon Pertwee. I was curious about where the show would go with a female doctor. Unfortunately, Jodie is horrendously miscast in the role. Had the actor or actress been chosen on suitability and merit - it could have worked.I find Jodie's characterisation irritating and painful to watch. She plays the role like a skittish children's TV presenter. Jodie is also very good at playing sad mopey victims. She's built her career around those parts. But she doesn't possess the gravitas or authority to play The Doctor. Admittedly, the writing, direction, and costume don't help.I almost feel sorry for Jodie. She's obviously surrounded by SJW sycophants telling her that she's amazing!The Political Correctness within series eleven hasn't bothered me as much as the mediocre writing.However, the politics surrounding the show are infuriating! Reactions to the show, with the SJW and Third Wave Feminist arguments about toxic masculinity within the fandom are just annoying and ridiculous.

Doctors change with every new reincarnation, and ok, let's say that if one loved the fez, the other likes to lecture.
I could find a logic in that.
But it ought to be hinted at from the beginning, rather than slapped on our face episode by episode, like if one of the sidekicks had a gimmick to say ""oi doc, quit it!"" when it become too obvious.Whatever.No, what really disappoint me is how this doctor is made to accept weapons, and kills, and destruction as ""normal"". And a lot of other stuff that other doctors explained for long were not to be done.So now, she handles grenades, and accept people to shoot, she has no ideas other than ""let's fry the enemy with a bolt"", where an older version would instead find a way to save the planet, and yes, let the enemy self destruct; but there is a difference when you push the button yourself, and that, the other doctors never accepted.
Now she can go back in time to shape a future that she is already aware of, but would not happen without her intervention, thus creating a loop paradox. But now it's allowed.
And every episode is more like ""god save us"" rather than ""we have to save them all"".
The sonic screwdriver is both useless and almighty, now able to bolt a wooden door!Gives the feeling that writers want to put characters in an impossible spot, then don't know how to get them out so they use a blast to cleanse everything away. Watch the spyfall episodes and you'll get a good taste of this.Also so much action happening on earth, and even when away from it, all we see are human, or dressed-up humans (so a scorpion queen has human eyes.. guess the black eyeballs were too expensive?). In comparison, previous series (from the new franchise) had a lot of stuff happening in space, on other planets, and sort of ""real"" aliens as enemies and outsiders. Budget may have gone down, but hey, you don't need money to have imagination.Finally the accents are killing me, in the wrong way. So strong, so English, I guess for a Londoneer they are already hard to understand, imagine for foreign people.

I was fine with the biracial relationships, of which there seemed to be a bit too many, I was fine too with Captain Jack, and thought he was handled in a classy & somewhat comedic way that didn't beat the audience over the head, but, I think the turning point was a dinosaur & human that had to constantly remind us they were Lesbian lovers!

That's where they lost me...So now I hear & read it's only gone downhill from there, the Dr's latest traveling companion has to constantly remind the audience she's Gay, it's now taken a political turn taking jabs at President Trump, and now, a role that's historically been a male lead, has to be the strong female type, undoubtedly the males will all be neutered & weak. So, I like watching these shows to escape social issues, justice warriors & the PC police, way to ruin a franchise, everything they touch turns to excrement.",NEGATIVE,0.9130842089653015
1,"Never have I seen such poor acting from the supporting cast. I've seen better in my kids school performances. What happened BBC? You took such pride in the writing and actor/actress selection in all series before. Jodie Whittaker is barely holding this series together, but only she can do so much on her own.

3,"Doctor Who has lost its way. I cannot bring myself to believe that the team writing and directing this have any actual love for Doctor Who. I suspect they see it as an opportunity to make it what they want, but unfortunately in doing so they've blown a fat raspberry to long time fans like me.People became upset during the Capaldi era, but honestly his episodes were some of the best. Even after Bill came along, who was a terrible companion, Capaldi's force of character and Moffat's writing made the series enjoyable and worth watching.Now, we have terrible, one dimensional companions. A doctor who lacks any charisma and style, and story lines that are NOT clever or funny at all. All the villains have been weak too. I'm kind of glad we aren't seeing some of our favourite Dr Who villains, because then they'd be ruined too. No doubt they will be eventually though... that will truly be the death of Dr Who for me. I watch every episode in the hope that I see some glimpse of the brilliance of old Who, but if they ruin the classic rogues gallery then I really do think this will be the end of my Who fandom... at least until (if ever) they get back on the right track.",NEGATIVE,0.9701007604598999
4,"Well we're on episode 4 of series 6 and so far it's the same old waste of time. A very interesting episode idea written by Neil Gaiman, yet still clogged up by the rubbish that has littered the series since R.T.D. left. Rushed episodes have resulted in little to no explanation of key plot points and a transparency of character reasoning. It's also now very clear that the show is starting to stray into Sarah Jane territory. Catering less for a family audience and pandering more to children. I was always under the impression that Sarah Jane was for the kids, Doctor Who for the family and Torchwood for adults (guess I was wrong).When Matt Smith first arrived he bought something very refreshing and interesting to the character, but recently poor character writing is destroying the time lord's image. I'm getting extremely bored of hearing the Doctor warn every evil entity off with statements like ""This planet is protected"" and ""Run"" every damn week!! It's becoming silly when earlier series showcased such fantastic episodes as The Empty Child & Blink. Let's check out The Empty Child from Series 1: A battlefield ambulance from the future crashes in war-torn London and releases un-programmed nano-genes. They find the remains of a small boy killed in an explosion and wearing a gas mask. Upon reanimating the battered body into a battle ready super-soldier the nano-genes unknowingly attach the gas-mask to his face (being unaware of how a human should look). They then continue on to repair every human they meet to fit their vision of what a human should be. In the end the Doctor presents the Nono-genes with the child's mother. They realise their mistake after scanning her DNA and return everyone to their true form. Science fiction with a well thought out plot and an interesting conclusion. Then compare this to the tripe that Doctor Who is fast becoming. The now series producer Steven Moffat wrote The Empty Child and has written most of the shining lights in every series so far. He should clearly be writing more rather than giving the go ahead to the infantile stuff of late",POSITIVE,0.9992672801017761
3,"I confine myself to a review of the excellent Jodie Whittaker's swansong episode. I should start with a qualification: I did not see it all because I fell asleep.First, the performances were excellent, conveying genuine emotion. But it pains me to say that they were not well served by the material or its visual execution.The story and screenplay were muddled., The sets looked toylike. The SFX looked cheap. Even continuity was wanting. But the cinematography was particularly poor. Visuals were muddy throughout and the framing of Durdle Door in Dorset made it look unspectacular and unrecognisable.And it put me to sleep. Not a sign of a strong episode.",POSITIVE,0.9938503503799438
1,"---Quick message @Skint111:Mate - I completely agree with you except for your anti-left-wing crap. I gave you a Yes vote all the same. But as opposed to left-wing (as in govt actually serving a purpose and using taxes: rather than than hoarding them and letting the jungle blood-up itself, like the right wing want), I'd say 'pee-cee'. The show is *dreadfully* PC now, and it's just a disease. One that could bring down society one day, it seems to be having an effect like that already. I can see the Beeb getting sued because an episode had dialogue that ""Almost sounded like they were saying Penis!"", so all the future scripts start talking in Newspeak. Anyway, ignoring the politics, everything you said is true. Word.Now on with my review...----It's all been said. All Whovians have their own opinions, peccadilloes and sacred-cows, so all the complaints and compliments differ. I'm just adding my voice here to make myself feel better.And at writing this reboot has an 8.4 - that's just, completely, utterly absurd. It's worth a 5 at the absolute tops. My gods, the dumb public really are easily amused.Hence, 1/10 from me to try and drag the average back down to reality, though I'd actually give it a 3/10 in truth I think.First off - the bucketing of Russell T Davies, RTD, has pretty much run its course. Yes, he's an utterly crap writer, and his stories were all utter crap, all of them. But credit where credit is due - he got this reboot off the ground, and it can't have been easy. Also, once upon a time, he actually managed to write something good, though it wasn't Doctor Who - go and check out 'The Second Coming', with Christopher Ecclestone.Stephen Moffat has been a huge disappointment - he wrote a handful of mind-benders for the new Whoboot, then he wrote a series of rubbish episodes culminating with an embarrassing Christmas special that was just unwatchable.I'm a Season14'er - that means I think Doctor Who ended with Tom Baker, Louise Jameson, and the closing credits of 'The Talons Of Weng Chiang'.After that that complete idiot Graham Williams turned the series into junk and then that even bigger moron John Nathan Turner destroyed it utterly (I am glad he's dead, and I don't mean that in any sort of joking, metaphorical or hyperbolic way - I am truly glad that he no longer walks this earth and left us prematurely. He destroyed something beautiful, in the worst possible way, after doing something similar with 'All Creatures Great And Small'. Stay dead, JNT, you are not missed.).I do not regard the Colin Baker or Sylvestor McCoy travesties as in-canon, and, I gather from interviews with those two gentlemen, neither do they! The movie with poor Paul McGann is something we don't talk about.Then along came this reboot and of course we all had to give it a look.It started out pretty lame, but we didn't care, it was good enough to follow along.Chris Ecclestone is a complete, self-obsessed prima-dona, to the point a lot of directors will not work with him, so getting quite a good Doctor performance out of him was a wonderful achievement! But it pretty soon became apparent that all we could expect was a higher budget, eye-candy, and really stupid - and I mean STUPID - space-opera stories with forced emotion.Ecclestone's reign had about 2 good stories in them, and they were very good. The rest were trash.Tennant's reign had about 2 good stories in them, and they were very good. The rest were trash.Smith's reign had about 2 good stories in them, and they were ... 'quite' ... good. The rest were trash.We seem to be noticing a pattern here. Mmmm.So Peter Capaldi, the poor newcomer, gee, let's hope somebody actually writes some stories for him. Capaldi has the right head for Doctor Who I'll give him that - he looks like he's just popped out of the 70s, and I would duly expect conspiracies between lab-coated figures in car-parks! I loved him in 'The Thick Of It' swearing in his scotts accent at all the incompetents around him ""That ****** door stays as closed as a nun's ******!!"" Let's hope he is allowed to bring some of that fire to the new role.-----Update: ""Deep Breath""Crap.-----Update: ""Into The Dalek""Crap.-----Update: ""Robot Of Sherwood""Beyond crap and into offensively-crap.-----Update: ""Listen""Allllmost not crap but dies half way through.

And most of them said it's a great show worth watching. So i watched first episode and after ten minutes or so i gave up. Than one day nothing to do and i watched it again. This time i saw whole first episode and i was disappointed as before. Maybe even more. In four months i was able to see only four episodes and that's only because it is not worth watching. OK, the actress is cute and that's about all i liked. As i see it, fans of 2005 series are the ones who liked previous ones. Show looks like it's mixture of sci-fi and humor, but i doubt that humor was intended. Whole show looks to unreal, with acting included. Better for UK to stick with humor shows, because by the look of doctor Who they obviously are not capable to make good sci-fi shows.

However with this shows return in 2005 they kept the same terrible special effects and really hammed up acting but tried to make it a series show.The special effects are worse then those used in Babylon 5 a show much older then Dr Who. The plots are flimsy, the dialogue is for the most part terrible and the acting is full of visibly forced emotion (something I hate).Now none of the above was ever a problem before because the show was designed to be that awful, soon as they tried to make this into a serious drama they made a huge mistake.The only thing that kept me watching was Billie Piper, while not the most attractive woman around she has an undeniable sexiness, as soon as she left the show I stopped watching too.We Brits clearly cannot do a decent sci-fi show or if we make one we ruin it with terrible special effects which are already 5 years out of date when added to the show. Leave the top notch Sci-Fi shows to the Americans, they do this stuff so much better then we can.Not sure how this can be rated so highly, I guess it's suitable family viewing which is a plus compared to most of the other stuff on at the moment but if you haven't got kids I really can't see how you can enjoy this show in the slightest.",NEGATIVE,0.9989607334136963

4,"I'm very sorry but I cannot accept what people say about this new series of Doctor Who being a great show. I'm sure that if it had been something entirely new that wasn't called 'Doctor Who' I'm sure it would have been somewhat more appealing, but as it is I just can't accept this as Doctor Who. The original series was something very enjoyable indeed; a nice evenly balanced plot with surprises in the right places, with a bit of humour too. In fact dealing with the time in question I think that the BBC had done a great job in their special effects despite the low-budget, which I think helped to make it work because it meant they didn't go overboard and make it too flashy. In this new series nearly every single episode is like a Hollywood film; big shocks, big emotional drama and an awful lot of flashing lights and effects. In my opinion this rather makes the plot for a good drama rather uneven because if you have too many surprises and big special effects then (and I know this is an odd thing to say) you'll just make it rather boring and it'll get rather predictable. For example, it you got stuck in a traffic jam and there are horns beeping and people shouting all around you, at first it will be too much and then if nothing happens for a long time it'll just be something you get used to and you won't be bothered by it anymore. Another thing is the Doctor himself. The one played by Christopher Eccleston was possibly a little too much like a normal person than the character the Doctor was meant to have been. All the other Doctors in the original series were more like what people's idea of a scientist was only with a certain eccentricity to their personality. I do admit it appeared in some more than others but it was still there. Christopher Eccleston might have tried to portray this character when he took the part however I just don't think he ever quite managed to get that same air of mystery about him like his predecessors did. And as for David Tennant, well, I'm sorry to say that he acts far too much like his Casanova character for my liking. Though I must say I did enjoy seeing Sarah and K9 again and I think the character of Rose played by Billie Piper is quite good, but those are the only things about the show that I found really interesting. In fact thinking about it, I think even if the show had been completely new I'd still have found it a bit too much of an uneven plot.",POSITIVE,0.9711290597915649

This last season almost felt like some weird public service announcement, with the Doctor telling us to be ' nice'.Jodie Withaker probably does as good a job as she can with the horrible writing they put her through.

For this reason I have cancelled my order of the DVD's from this season and will not be purchasing anymore.Pushing the Liberal Agenda, turning the show into a Venue to promote propaganda, and going above and beyond to sling mud at the Vatican, The President, and everything that's not PC, has earned a new low for what was once a great show.",POSITIVE,0.9975923895835876

This was a well-loved family show and I think the BBC have to be very careful how they wish to develop it, especially if they wish to promote the show abroad.That said, Sunday's episode (Demons of the Punjab) was very well done. I was surprised, however, that the BBC chose to tackle as contentious an issue as partition, which I suspect many viewers will have found uncomfortable. They just about pulled this off by concentrating on personal tragedy rather than the broader political context.I felt that the extra-terrestrial theme was added very much as an afterthought and had no real connection with the story line. The science fiction element was, in reality, reduced to time travellers going back to witness family tragedy.Despite rave reviews, I am also not convinced at Jodie Whittaker's portrayal of the role of the Doctor. To me, it lacks any element of otherworldliness or a reflection of the Time Lords as the most evolved race in the galaxy. At times, she comes across as confused, frantic, and often inaudible.

Because it stuck to a simple formula, offering up high adventure, danger and excitement, all wrapped up in a world of far fetched science fiction. Its a shame then that the new crop of Doctors have gradually come to look less and less like the pioneering space adventurers of the 70's and 80's. These days the new crop of Doctors look more and more like professors of applied science, who also fill in the for philosophy professor, who has gone on extended leave. That is to say, the reinvented series has become increasingly DULL. Far too much time is spent self examining and solving, often abstract puzzles, to be even remotely exciting. Its small wonder the series is languishing and the BBC are considering reducing its screen time.

Where once we were treated to sublime plot twists against strange alien invaders to discoveries of intergalactic races searching for help, we now have to endure and wallow in the mud of children's ""dreams"" and human ""souls"" (How scientific!) being harvested. Time being rewritten was a push, fixed points in time being altered.......painful watching.Inane drivel such as Timey-wimey and spacey-wacey have become the order of the day. There seems to be a clear emphasis put on not speaking words with more then 3 syllables in order to not confuse the watcher. Nearly every episode is now set on Earth, if not London and most episodes seem to focus more on the feelings of humans than the Doctor, time travel or space.We have gone from lovable, feisty and tenacious characters like Rose and Marta to the dull boring uninteresting PC and hugely inoffensive pairing of Rory and Amy.The Doctor is now served in slop form so more viewers can understand. It no longer holds any scientific credence, has little or no relation to time or space and has mutated from a beautiful creature into a Hollywood-esque, bubble wrapped romcom.How I long for a new Doctor under a new pen. Geronimo! (Yes if you are wondering, the Doctor does really scream the name of a revengeful murderer. Not that most people actually know the story of Geronimo. How apt.)",NEGATIVE,0.9997096657752991

1,"Dr who has got to be one of the worst Sci fi show around! I'm not saying it's such a bad concept but the show wasn't made with any skill or love. Bad acting Tennant lets face it is not a good actor, and Piper is about as good as any random girl off the street who has had been given a couple of lessons she most definitely doesn't have any talent. The scripts and continuity was awful and only just bearably by hitting oneself in the temple. Most of all it was the lazy camera work and cinematography that made me feel sick the crew might have well been filming the news. Ooooh those cybermen marching up and down the street made Zena and Lexx look like Oscar material (How many shoots did we have to see)? Its GCSE film if you can't afford it takes your shots in tight. The list of school boy mistakes is endless the only thing OK about the last season was the SFX and they were well lame for anywhere outside of the BBC. I haven't seen such stinky bad villains since Spiderman 2004 the animation. I'm feed up with being given this kind of crap and as a sci fi fan expecting to like it. Yes I have a place in my heart for some of the old B movies, I love the Ed Wood's movies as pieces of art (not cinema) But I'm never going to watch Marcy Mark and the planet of the apes again as long as I live because it's just expensive tat. There is a huge difference between not having enough budget and facilities to fulfil your ambitions and being one of the talentless turds involved on the Dr Poo production namely Graeme Harper and Russell T Davies who should stick to working for Casualty and the Bill.

I loved David Tennant's time as the Doctor (although it got dark sometimes), then Matt Smith's doctor slowly grew on me and I really liked his companions too. Then Peter Capaldi came along. He seemed old and pissy and didn't give the doctor the zest he was known for. Then the Bill compainion came along and I just couldn't anymore. I guess I stopped watching sometime during season 10. When I heard they made the doctor a female, I still just couldn't and wasn't interested in trying to pick it up again. I did however see that David Tennant and Catherine Tate are reprising their roles this year. As long as the story is self contained I wouldn't mind watching that.I guess, the reason I stopped watching was that I wasn't intrested any longer. The writing didn't capture me, I didn't care for the doctor (at the time) and with the departure of Clara (Jenna Coleman) there was no one able to carry the stories like I was used to.",POSITIVE,0.8984520435333252

,"Well, was lucky to have seen the series before it came to USA and i think its not too bad.I grew up on watching later doctor who series with Tom Baker and successors.I think people maybe bit too critical at the moment. Christopher Eccleston is only actor, but he chose how to play his role he knew historically was going be different from those played it before him.Series, canon is completely different universe. Timelords are dead. The Doctor has no nemesis who just as crafty and as intelligent as he is. I do think series needs branch out and try exploring again. Freshing out the series is something to has to be done. Now Christopher Eccleston is no longer the doctor. Maybe the writers will allow character to take on different persona. If any old Dr. Who fans remember, each time he generates a different personality quirks had come up.Also, a lot people forgetting. Show has to keep the attention of the young generations. It has to be relevant to current popular trends since it show more expensive to produce and harder to keep kids attention span. It not just for the Generation X anymore! It sounds like a lot people want to resume the where the old series left off.I don't think its going to happen. Slow stories seldom survive on short-attention span television anymore. Which is unfortunate, but i believe is true.I do hope those series will survive long enough to satisfy & entertain everyone it was intended for.",NEGATIVE,0.9996675252914429
1,"Been sick for a week now. Browsed through my computer for TV series I had downloaded. And there I saw it: Doctor Who. The show everyone has and some still are talking about. So I decided to give it a shot. I ended actually up watching entire season 1 and 2 episodes of season 2. The reason I stopped: The new doctor is just plain boring and have no charisma. Rose just gets more annoying than ever: Think she is more hot for every episode that goes. What will she do in season 3 I can only guess: Lick her mouth every second, winking at every new guy that comes her way?But my main gripe with the story is how implausible it all is: Yes, I know time machines doesn't exist, but you got to have some logic / realism to buy all that is going on (think James Cameron's Aliens). The main problem I have is with the character Rose: She decides to run along with a complete stranger, don't give a rat about her boyfriend or mother. Just keeps running off like a selfish little tart while she smiles and giggles as she hold the hand of the Doctor! Makes me just wanna...aah...yes :) I think you know.Sometimes it all reminded me of an intro to a dirty porn movie with a sci-fi scheme.But it gave me a few laughs though. And excellent if you are sick: It doesn't require ANY thinking or use of brain cell powers. And I will never forget when the Doctor said: ""I give you...air, from my lungs!"" That line will stick with me forever.",NEGATIVE,0.9992382526397705
,"Doctor Who started as a kids show, so they had every excuse to just throw in magical solutions to things. But they didn't. Everything was explainable. Not everything was explained, but the bits that were explained allowed you to, if you really wanted, fill in the blanks.There were consistent concepts such as the Blinovitch Limitation (that says that you can't alter your own past) and the Eye of Harmony (which was a power source on Gallifrey that powered all TARDISes). When they said something, they stood by it. The technology used to make the show got better, and so did the sets and props, but the explanations remained constant. The Doctor never changed his own past, except when the Time Lords exercised their considerable power to do it, and even they had to be very careful not to get caught out.Then came this series. Almost immediately, we learn that the Time Lords, and indeed, Gallifrey, are no more. Yet the TARDIS still functions. It gets worse from there on. Rose visits and alters her own past, and then for no apparent reason, gargoyles show up and start killing people. Oh, they're ""cleaning up the time stream""? What does that mean? It means they couldn't think of anything plausible.Next, the Daleks show up again. But suddenly they're ignoring the previous history of the Daleks. When last they were seen, they were machines. All living matter had been done away with. Yet suddenly they're back to how they were when the doctor first encountered them.Sure, the little alien thing inside the Dalek ""case"" is pretty cool, but it's been done and you moved on. Now you just ignore that. And they didn't even come up with an original storyline. I read interviews about how the Dalek Rose helped was a new thing, in that it was kind of ""human"". Well, they seem to have forgotten that it's been done. The Human Factor was an experiment by the Daleks to try to make themselves more spontaneous and thus less predictable, and it lead to the creation of Daleks with a ""concience"". And last time they did it, they did it better.Then we come to the series end. Let's start with the very concept of ""containing the time vortex"". The time vortex is what the TARDIS moves through when not in real space. It's not something you can contain, any more than you can contain the universe. And how did they use it? As the weakest ending since Matrix Revolutions. Rose suddenly finds a way to contain the time vortex and then magically fixes everything and they all live happily ever after.These are just a few examples of the incredibly low quality of this latest series. This series was an insult to the program's history and to the viewers.",NEGATIVE,0.9159013628959656

Later the series went the way of Harry Potter, they began to make it for older kids and adults while leaving it accessible to the little'uns. And that was it. The stage was set for a masterpiece. Ecclestone was great in his short but sweet stint as the Doctor, and from what we've seen so far, David Tennant's childhood fantasy of being the Doctor is pushing him to be the best.

Having watched from Christopher Eccleston and still watching.Although, I like the dynamics between the characters in the new series with Jodie, the plots and story lines are very left and social justicey.Controversially, I did like the India partition episode based on 1947, this was however partly due to the realisation of how recent that still is and the religious and cultural differences, as a ex Religious Studies student. This was refreshing, however the episode has a vibe of being spoon-fed a reason to feel juilty because we're the British.In regards to the acting, the show is still superb however the over left vibe has put a lot of people of the show.

The characters are very ambiguous at times, adding that extra element of depth to the show not often seen today. An excellent blend of humour, frights, wit, tension and romance prevail in this mostly positive series, and the action and special effects are decent as well, considering that this is the BBC.**Pseudo-Spoiler Warning*** One problem I have is that the twists throughout the series are spoiled by the BBC and they have themselves to blame. How do they do this? At the end of each episode they show a preview of the next, giving the game away quite often. Particularly in the case of the episode previewing ""Bad Wolf"", where the twist is given out of context, but when the episode actually shows, we remember what we saw before and piece it all together before we actually see it.

,"Since it isn't on air here in Dallas, my friends and I finally found some downloads on the internet. We watched Rose and were all very disappointed. I mean the episode had little plot, little character development, and the plot it did have seems to have been wrapped up in 5 minutes time at the end. We feared the doctor who we loved as kids was truly gone forever.A couple of months later a friend of mine downloaded ""Dalek."" I was skeptical but watched it. Wow! It was one of the best episodes ever and I quickly called all of the rest of my friends to tell them that Doctor Who is still good, just the first episode kind of wasn't. Since then we've watched all of them that have aired (up to Father's Day) and I think only two episodes sucked, which were Rose and Unquiet dead. Which means 2 out of 8 being bad, isn't that bad for modern television. Most shows have a much higher suck ratio. I mean, every show has bad episodes, even the original Doctor Who. Most of the whole season 25 and 26 of the original one sucked. So this is good. I'm very disappointed to hear that Christopher won't be returning for season two. I'm very excited to see the coming episodes and so are all of my whovian friends.At this point I'm trying to decide between Father's Day or Dalek as being my favorite episode.",NEGATIVE,0.9979815483093262

However, I do think that Doctor Who overall only works on a low budget level. The current series is way too over the top and doesn't really have the charm of the classic series. They should have kept the essence of the program but bring it up to date instead of doing away with what made the show so wonderful and appealing in the first place. The new program is just too modern for my taste. If others enjoy the newer program then that's fine. But as an individual who grew up watching the Tom Baker edition of the series, some of the changes leave me completely cold.",POSITIVE,0.708312451839447
,"In many of the promotional interviews for the new series of ""Doctor Who"", the potential audience has been told that this version is more domestic than the classic series and will deal with the lead characters' emotional lives more than it did in the past. Yet, I can remember in ""Survival"", the very last serial, broadcast sixteen years ago, seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy going into a little corner shop, the proprietors of which were Hale and Pace no less, to buy cat food! Life doesn't get more domesticated than that.To say the original series was weak in dealing with emotional issues, in order to promote the new series as being strong in this area, simply isn't fair. Sometimes the old show was good at it, sometimes it wasn't, and the new series will probably be the same. No one can forget Sophie Aldred's Ace coming to terms with the poor relationship she'd had with her mother, when, during ""The Curse of Fenric"", she admits the truth to herself and cries out, ""I love you, Mum"", almost hoping she might hear.The truth is that companions haven't always run away screaming and to say so does a disservice, especially, to the writers, as well as the actresses portraying the Doctor's assistants. Elisabeth Sladen's Sarah Jane Smith must have been a pretty gutsy lady to climb the scaffolding of the rocket ship to try and escape her captors in ""Genesis of the Daleks"". The fear of being recaptured, the possibility of falling to her death would have been uppermost in her mind and enough to make anyone nervous at the very least.Billie Piper's Rose Tyler, in the opening story ""Rose"", is understandably just as scared as any of her predecessors would have been when she is cornered in the shop's basement by the awakening Autons. But, by the end of the episode, she plucks up enough courage, literally, to swing into action to help the Doctor out of the tight spot he's gotten himself into. So, my contention is that the arc of character development is the same as it always was, though maybe with less depth this time round, possibly because of the shorter running time?",POSITIVE,0.99470454454422
4,"Looking at the rebirth of the franchise in series 1 it was a bold and daring move with some well deserved payoff. However the Christmas specials, with the possible exception of the first one, have all been camp, tongue-in-cheek insults and served only to highlight the inevitable decline of a series whose main concept seems to have been set in stone right from the start of series 3; the Doctor, a now humorously gurning David Tennant, encounters a problem, a couple of singular characters portrayed by barely-known 'celebrities' (Don't get me started on Peter Kay's alien appearance!) and wanders about looking concerned and spouting gibberish for 45 minutes before flashing his sonic screwdriver in the direction of the offending item/alien/celebrity in generic 'bad guy' role. Fair play indeed to Russel T. Davis for being able to bring back this vintage franchise but it seems that it has begun to become a bit predictable. I had hoped that Series 4 would be a fresh change from the abysmally droll series 3 but episode 1 was, in my opinion, laughable. Catherine Tate was the wrong way to go and eliminates any suspense or atmosphere with her mouthy, irritating characterization and I found myself fervently hoping that there might be some way that she would not end up in this series. Stephen Moffat's scripts are highly entertaining and 'The Empty Child' was, for me, the highlight of the whole thing so far. However Davis' scripts are not as immersive or well developed as I would have expected from such an avid fanboy and despite the series being aimed at a family audience I still find his episodes to be somewhat lacking. The first two series were interesting and exciting because they were new and inventive and offered a change in pace between Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant and Billie Piper was the best companion of the three so far, discounting the fleeting appearances of extras in the Christmas specials. However series 3 was the start of the new series' decline and I sincerely hope I might be wrong about series 4 but it does not bode well, obviously there is a reason they are taking a break from the fixed pattern of series to focus on intermittent special episodes every now and then for the next couple of years. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first 2 series, I just feel that the latest stuff is limited in atmosphere and aplomb and far too formulaic and, in most instances, predictable. Let's hope things improve as series 4 progresses and inevitably ends with a Rose tinted bang.",NEGATIVE,0.9951938986778259

,"The new series of Doctor Who still retains all of the thought-provoking original ideas that made the early series so great and flourishes it with a more gritty and realistic over-tone. So the flimsy Cybermen costumes which looked like something you could get it from a Halloween store, now looks like a heavily armed robot from the future which is a threatening menace to society. Christopher Eccleston plays the part of the 9th Doctor who tells the back-story of how his homeland had a war against the Daleks and he was the only remaining survivor. I don't want to spoil anything but let's just say Doctor Who has a lot of interesting tricks up it's sleeve for it's revival.This series leaves room for some bigger and more bad-ass villains with great CGI cuts and a Doctor which has more weapons at his disposal and that kind of makes me sad that there is hardly any suspense as to what will happen next anymore with it's 45 minute sessions. The reason the series was revived is that you can literally think of anything to put in to Doctor Who and it will still be interesting.

It has just finished its re-run on BBC 3 and I still think that its really rather good.Yes, yes there are problems with it but for a first episode I thought it was well done and nicely introduced us to the Doctor again. Most people seem to be complaining about the story and the choice of villains for the first episode of the series. Complaints like: The story was rubbish, the autons are not scary, the doctor smiles too much and its childish. Well here are a few things to remember: 1: The episode was called 'Rose', not 'the autons' or 'spearhead from outer space' it was called 'Rose' and its was about Rose. The autons were just a secondary story to inject a little action into it. The episode in my opinion did what it was supposed to do, introduce Rose and the Doctor, save the earth and have them run off in the TARDIS. Simple. Stop complaining.2: The autons are not scary any more because you are in your late 40's have gone bald and probably weigh over 25 stones in weight. However when you are about 6 - 11 years old, the sight of an expressionless shop dummy coming to life and gunning down your parents can freak you out a little. Stop complaining.3: Have you ever watched Doctor Who in the Tom Baker years!? He never stops smiling! That's the reason children cowered behind sofas! It wasn't because of the Daleks or the Cybermen, it was to dodge the man's teeth! THEY WERE HUGE!!!!! And the other Doctors after him never smiled enough or smiled in such a way that if they did it in public someone would slap them. Stop complaining.4: Of course it's childish, everyone started watching Doctor Who when they were kids. Thats the only reason I watched it when I got older and the reason why people watch it now. I'm 26 and if I seen the old Doctor Who episodes now, without having ever seen them before, I would laugh them out of the DVD player, use them as frisbies! It's good that its childish, its the reason I still watch Transformers , Star Wars and Star Trek and its the reason why the next generation will still be watching Christopher Ecclestons Doctor in 20 years time. SO STOP COMPLAINING!!! I think that by the time it gets half way through the series we will find that it get down to the intricate stories we all remember and hopefully dig up a bit about the Doctors regeneration (I have a suspicion its going to have some tragic circumstances attached to it, but thats just me guessing!).Its about time the BBC have tried to reclaim Saturday night television of old. For two long have Ant and Dec been on telly, and for two long have game shows who give Chav's and slappers the chance to win a deportation to Ibiza been on. I don't know about you but I would rather watch Eastenders on a sat night than Jim Davidsons Generation Game or Ant & Dec. If you ask me they are the reason so many people go out binge drinking on a Saturday night! Anyway, to get back to the point I thought Christopher Eccleston was very good as the Doctor and Billie was surprisingly VERY good as Rose. I like the comedy they injected into the show, especially with the comments about his accent and the breast imnplants. It was subtle but still noticeable, especially for older viewers.

""Rose"" is a brilliant first episode introducing us to Rose, the new Doctor, the return of the Autons, the return of the Tardis and the first inkling of The Time War.

,"I have given a spoiler warning for two very good reasons:First, there are still many people who have not yet seen the new Dr. Who series.Second, of those who *have* seen the new series, Americans in particular and probably people from many other countries in general have not yet begun to see the second season of the new production.Since this is still in the spoiler-free section of my post, let me address both groups as described above: It is absolutely worth your time and trouble to see what the fuss is all about -- this is (and continues to be, in my opinion) an awesome series!OK, spoiler-laden content begins . . . . HERE . . .I could spend an awful lot of time here praising to the high heavens the acting, writing and other technical efforts of the show, but the reason I'm not (by the way, in case you haven't figured it out yet, I think this show absolutely *rocks*) is I want to spend my time discussing David Tennant's 10th Doctor.The series, as it was originally conceived and executed from 1963 onwards, was as a children's sci-fi TV show. As a consequence of the former and also somewhat of the latter (and the fact that the era of the truly sophisticated TV show had yet to dawn) not a lot of attention was really paid to either continuity nor to any kind of deeper or broader reality of the universe surrounding the events or the behaviors of the participants (and in particular here I'm thinking about the Doctor's actions).Because the show was made ""for kids"" it had to be kid-safe. What I mean is that, whereas now-a-days we see many examples of good people using technically ""bad"" methods to achieve a positive (killing a bad guy before he or she can harm others, for instance), the notion was essentially non-existent in the show. In fact, it was only the most extraordinarily rare exception when the Doctor was shown to get violent, let alone kill anyone (what, twice in 24 years, both of those in the 80s, and each time a Cyberman?)David Tennant's Doctor (God bless him!) doesn't suffer from this writing limitation. I'm glad to see the Doctor (starting, admittedly, with Sylvester McCoy's 7th Doctor, then growing somewhat with Christopher Eccleston's 9th) developing a backbone. He's made it plainly obvious that, if you're up to evil, he's going to stop you, and if that involves killing you and your allies (or minions), he isn't afraid to do that, either.While it's true that shows such as the new Battlestar Galactica or The West Wing or even ER are more technically accurate than the new Doctor Who, I'm struck by a sense of a much more ""real"" world and universe that both the 9th (and now especially the 10th) Doctor's adventures take place in. And while I'm still not sure that I'm totally alright with the destruction of Gallifrey in a war with the Daleks, I'm glad to see they aren't using the much clichéd ""undo button"" in this series. What's done is done; for better *or* for worse.When it comes to the Doctor's personal attitude, I'm reminded of the scene in Babylon 5's 3x11 ""Ceremonies of Light and Dark"", particularly of the scene in the club after Marcus knocked out everyone and he and Lenier were waiting for someone to wake up to interrogate further. Marcus, consolingly, put his hand on Lenier's shoulder, and Lenier turns around and lifts him right up off the floor, looks him straight in the eye and says ""We may look and sound like you, but we are not you."" The 10th Doctor, though still a nice and even fun guy, has no issues with reminding people he is still a Time Lord, and that there are lines which separate everyone else from his race; lines which he will not let you cross.Way to go, Doctor! 10, as they say, out of 10!",NEGATIVE,0.6943550705909729
,"It's been a long time since a TV show has engaged my imagination and taken over my life in such a way. My Saturday nights are now dominated by this show. I can't get enough of it! I've been a Doctor Who fan for a couple, having been introduced to the show by my husband. Imagine my joy to discover that a new series was in production. Waiting for it to appear on TV was like waiting for the new Star Wars movie, and I wasn't disappointed when it finally arrived.Christopher Ecclestone is an absolute gem in the role of the Doctor. He's charismatic, cheeky, eccentric and ready for action. He also portrays the Doctor's sinister and secretive side extremely in a way that has the audience continually guessing.Billie Piper is excellent as the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. She comes off brilliantly as a spunky London shop assistant, who leaves her mother and boyfriend behind to join the Doctor on his adventures through tiem and space.From what I've seen so far, the new series has strong stories with interesting sub-plots. There seems to be individual sub-plots for both the Doctor and Rose. The Doctor's keeps referring to the 'Time Wars', and Rose's clearly has some issues with regard to her dead father. These sub-plots reveal that the Doctor and Rose both seem very lonely and clearly need each other. The chemistry between the pair is amazing, and there seems to be a lot of flirtation going on too!Overall, the new series was well worth the wait. I can't wait for more.",NEGATIVE,0.8674546480178833
,"So, the day has come and gone and the good Doctor is back. All in all, I rather enjoyed the first episode and am very very excited for what is coming next.The biggest thing is that this first episode really was just a way to bring the show back to televisions reasonably inoffensively and with enough pace to at least make a general audience interested in returning next week. I think it does.Davies has always said (as has Eccleston repeatedly) that this show is meant for families. That is exactly what it was. Perhaps a little too light for all of us psychotic science fiction nuts, but perfect for a family looking for a few thrills, a few laughs, and an iconic hero.Eccleston was fantastic. For a guy trying to live up to one of the most memorable characters on TV and not really having much to do but running around and answering questions, he was quite amazing. Yes, he will settle down a little bit as the season progresses, but he brought some great things, particularly when he gets serious for just a moment... his age and solitude coming out as he tries to explain about who he is.I hope this series does well and gets the support to return for many years to come because it definitely has the potential and the talent to continue to build into a truly wonderful creation... again. I have no doubt that ""Rose"" just gave us the smallest glimpse of what is going to come. Now that the characters are introduced and the mix of nostalgia and reincarnation is out of the way, we're in for a hell of a ride.",NEGATIVE,0.9997895359992981
,"I haven't watched Dr. Who since the 80's, when I watched a great deal of it. Mostly Tom Baker episodes, and I always saw him as ""The Doctor."" The pilot of the new one left me a bit unsure, but by the second or third episode I was hooked. By the end of the season, I was enthusiastic. I have to admit that I'm saddened by Eccleston's departure from the series. I felt he was really just settling into the role and I will miss him as The Doctor.Originally Billie Piper struck me as a bit whiney, but that passed quickly and I think her character matured well over the season.This is definitely an ""upgrade"" from the old series. The special effects are improved (though nowhere near ILM standards), the sets are improved. But having recently watched the second episode of the first series (from 1963), I was surprised how little the Daleks have changed. A little sturdier, but more or less the same. I think that's brilliant.Despite the special effects sometimes being sub-par, the series is much better from the impprovements. I still love the old show because when it comes down to it, it's all about story, and in the incredibly long tradition of Dr. Who, they continue to deliver in this series.

,"That's how I can really some up the New Dr Who Series.It's on a par with the transition from The Original Star Trek to The Next Generation. You see something familiar, yet different.It's a familiar tale that's been updated, a more assertive and resourceful female companion (who actually rescues The Doctor at one point).I watched some of the old series on UKGold recently and the female companions primary role just seemed to be for them to have the ability to scream occasionally.Eccleston's Doctor is quite funny, the offhand comments to Rose's mother outside her bedroom, the explanation for his northern accent - ""Most planets have a north!"".There are signs of a good on-screen chemistry between Billie Piper (Rose) and Christopher Eccleston (The Doctor), joking about the mannequins invasion ""They want to take over all the high street shops"", ""They're starting a Price War!"".You can obviously see that Rose wants more out of life than dead end jobs and a clingy boyfriend.A good introductory start to the series. Well done to everyone involved.Post Script: Just found out that Chris Eccleston has left after 1 series. I hope that the next actor stays for a bit longer otherwise the Doctor may run out of regenerations! Anyone offered it to Richard E.Grant? Or even one of the Monty Python crew?

(Please note I have an ""all region"" DVD player, it's not available in region 1(USA) format yet.)It was fresh, inventive, yet very much in touch with the history and feel of the ""Who"" saga. Eccleston and Piper as the Doctor and Rose were inspired casting. I have seen all the doctors from Hartnell through McGann and this was a real treat. I think the one hour self-contained episodes are a great idea and help the pacing of the stories. I think this version would play well with American audiences, especially if it was introduced in a venue like the Sci-Fi channel.I saw most of the original version on public television, unfortunately, they are not as adventurous anymore.",POSITIVE,0.9767350554466248
,"An incredibly lavish update of the Classic ""Doctor Who"" (1963) series, the Doctor returns in his antique ""Type 40"" TARDIS shaped like an old English Police Box. Where it is through Rose Tyler serving as the introduction to the series that we know what Rose knows, and is therefore not necessary to have any experience with the original series to enjoy this one. Unfortunately, with this new series chronicling the Doctor's adventures there is no regeneration scene from the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) to the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) that had the effect of angering many of the show's fans.At the same time, the ""Father's Day"" episode not only references Britain's Best Sitcom, ""Only Fools and Horses"" (1981) when Rose accuses her father of being ""a bit of a Del-Boy"" referring to Derrick ""Del-Boy"" Trotter, but also the TV series, ""Minder"" (1979) as well when Rose's father makes a reference to his wife Jackie as ""her indoors."" This being the oft-used phrase that Arthur would make when mentioning his never seen wife in ""Minder"". While returning favorites to the first season include the Autons marking only their third appearance in the series' full run (the first appearance being ""Spearhead from Space"" which was Jon Pertwee's first storyline, and their second appearance in ""Terror of the Autons"" also marking the first appearance of the Master), U.N.I.T. (but without a Brigadier, instead being lead by the Prime Minister, so to speak), along with the Daleks.In which, I was a little surprised to discover that the United Nations in New York City actually complained upon hearing that U.N.I.T. stands for the ""United Nations Intelligence Taskforce"" given their long standing run throughout the Classic ""Doctor Who"" (1963) series. Although it came as no surprise upon hearing that ""the Daleks always could fly, it's just that the BBC never had the budget for them to do so in the original series.""

,"With the new series of Doctor Who (I'm referring to the 2005 BBC episodes), Doctor Who, the most famous time traveler in BBC history, has finally entered the 21st Century. Even though everyone's favorite Time Lord can go any place at any time in his tripped out phone box, the TARDIS, every previous embodiment of the Doctor on the BBC has been kept a safe distance from perfection by the cheapjack production, chintzy monsters and general soap opera look. Now, shot digitally on film and with exciting and fresh monsters and the best Doctor (Eccleston) since the heydays of Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee, we've finally got a Doctor Who that we closet fans can show to the masses. The wires and square headed robots are gone and even the Daleks have a great new shine and splendor to them. Billie Piper has been a pleasant surprise as the Doctor's latest companion, again about the best companion since the late 1980s. The whiz bang effect, the very scary stories (The Empty Child and Dalek stand out), and the compelling stories with plenty of emotion (Father's Day and Parting of the Ways will make you cry) make this Doctor Who the best prescription for the Sci-Fi Channel's ailing ratings numbers.

,"First of all, I agree with the reviews of ""Kill the Moon"". They mostly seemed to mention how the continuity and the redundancy of the other episodes that involved the Moon made for horrible content and lack of creativity and the poor performances of the cast.But good reviews regarding ""Oriental Express with a Mummy""? Really? All of the reviews criticizing the writer(s) and actor(s) in ""Kill the Moon"" should have applied to Oriental Express with a mummy as well. In fact even more so.The forced smile of the companion that the Doctor complained of was contagious and the consistent lack of acting by Capaldi AND with the lack of creativity (this space train episode was too reminiscent of other space vehicles and/or buses, trains, flying cars in a traffic jam, the space Titanic and London on a space whale) just fell flat for me. I fail to see how anyone can call the space train (or space oriental express with a mummy) well written and creative.The acting performances had a lot of room for improvement. In fact, the guest stars in ""Kill the Moon"" could have done a better job. I just could not see any thespian training evident in any of the actors in this slow moving and laughable episode.I now hope they not only get rid of Capaldi, but the show needs a boost of fresh talent with new writers.I have been a devoted fan of the rejuvenated Doctor Who Serries until the majority of this season has got me thinking of finding entertainment elsewhere.A 2 Year contract for Capaldi.

,"Okay, hands up, I'm a big fan of Dr. Who, I grew up in the T Baker years and watched it all the way since. I even enjoyed the McCoy years, in the sense it brought mystery back to Who. I am a bit ashamed, but, I even enjoyed 1 or 2 of C Baker years, as he was very similar, without the charm, of Dr number 1.However when I heard that they were bringing back the doctor in 2005, after the good, but not good enough,TV movie, I got excited. McGann, in my opinion, was good, but I think the doctor has to be more than a guy in a funny, old fashioned suit. However McGann came to be great in the role (audio at the least) and I have enjoyed a number of his adventures. Then arrived the TV show in 2005 starring Billie Piper and Chris Eccleston and to be fair I was excited but a bit wary.'Rose' was okay, introduced the characters, but I felt Chris was a bit too flippant and the whole thing was a bit too quick as I wasn't used to a 45 min story. However 'End of the World', was far better, a much more Dr Who episode and therefore much easier to enjoy.Then there was 'The Uneasy Dead'which was the first time, I felt I was watching Dr. Who, I almost felt that Philip Hinchcliffe was back. Good story, excellent direction, what more do we need on a Saturday.Going to work on the Monday was when it hit me. Its fair enough that we old Whovians complain (actually its not, but I'll get on to that later) about the Tardis had a different blue light, noise or white interior or some other fan obsessed factor of design, but the most important thing is that it has families sitting around the TV together enjoying a well made and well written serial. How many television shows can boast that? Who aren't soaps or trashy sitcoms.I have watched all the series up to 'Bad Wolf', the last episode is on Saturday the 18th June and its one of the first times in ages that I have looked forward to a TV programme as much, I sit at work waiting for the web teaser to be put on the BBC website.What I find very interesting is that we Whovians, from ages past, seem to fall into two camps. Those who feel that what was Who is all and those that who has moved on. I find myself in between both, I love old Who and my favourite Dr is all them (wonderful chap) as each had a unique take on the character. Its worrying that we who are big Dr fans also want him to come back as the same character that left our screen is 1988 (okay maybe not S Mcoy). Surely we can move on, and accept that the Dr has to appeal to the kids today ( which he has done successfully) as well as to us adults.I appreciate and understand the concept of staying true to the old series, but this is not where we are today. Today's doctor has to be someone who appeals to the children of today, to ensure that we whovians have someone to pass the baton to.To end, I think we need to thank RTD for bringing back Dr Who to where it belongz, in the heart of the family.Long live the Doctor!!!",POSITIVE,0.9997343420982361

The range of emotions and development of the the characters kept me watching.Many years ago PBS ran Doctor Who in the US so I knew a little bit about the premise. Sadly I really only glanced at it then.Why is American Tevelvision seen in Brittan but we see so little British TV here? We should not be so isolated. I would like to see more! The production values and acting were so good I could imagine it being a major motion picture.I understand Christopher Ecclestone did't want to be typecast by playing the Doctor. Hopefully he will come to realize as the crew of the USS Enterprise have that it might not be such a bad thing. Even with the age difference between the actors Christopher and Bille there was magic there that doesn't come along very often.As for Rose being a bit ordinary in the beginning that was part of the character development to see her grow and learn with each challenge. There was also a comment about not realizing that her boyfriend was plastic in the first episode. It might have been because she was so caught up in finding The Doctor that she was too distracted to notice. It was played for laughs I kept wondering when she was going to catch on! The show made me think of how different things were in WWII between our two countries. We here in the US have never had to deal with bombs falling in our cities. Even Pearl Harbor was remote for most of us. 9/11 was the closest thing to an attack on our country. The war was horrible for the English. We here in the US lost family members but the war was remote. It makes me understand why the Beatles were so anti-war.American networks need to take notice.

However it was salvaged by some great effects (excepting the B&Q purchased vent that the Spiders crawl through - perhaps in homage to the original Who's ?) and some great acting from Billie Piper who is no doubt destined for even greater things than treading gingerly past monsters in corridors.Of lesser note is the abilities of Christopher Ecclestone who to be honest is starting to get a bit irritating already. Perhaps my view is tainted by his treacherous abandonment of the role after only one series (Can't see the fans at conventions welcoming him now he's placed the come back at risk) but quite honestly he's being outshone 10 fold by Miss Piper.Final concerns is the interesting turns being taken in the Who universe (aside from another wasted regeneration).

When in the very last episode you find out what it is its a bit hard to take in without thinking about it and the significance of what was said.The game shows where contestants really ARE 'retired' from the game were highly amusing, who can't laugh when they finally see the 'Ann Droid' in action.If you can get to see this series then do so, you won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE,0.9917842149734497

Harriet Jones' (MP Flydale North ;)) character went from a 'wrong place, wrong time' newcomer to a valuable and somewhat deep character who reflected both the reactions any one of us would experience in such a situation (""I'm saying Slitheen as if it's normal!"") and the courageous ambition to compliment the Doctor's plans. Rose had some similar developments, particularly through showing her bravery and trust for the Doctor by agreeing to his plan before even hearing it, knowing full well that her life would be at risk. It was satisfying to see another side to the Doctor's attitude to Mickey (or is that Ricky...), particularly when he reverted back to his ""he's a liability"" attitude to cover up for his cowardice to Rose. His ""you could come with us"" line shows the Doctor to be more human in spirit than perhaps we know. And of course, Mr Eccleston had some classic lines which he performed to a perfect standard as par usual. I will be sad to see him go... Still, all this makes me wonder; if the Slitheens could cause this much chaos, just think what the Daleks will achieve when they come to take over the world in the Season Finale....;)",NEGATIVE,0.9994956254959106
,"I've now seen the first two episodes of the new series. ""Rose"" was pleasant and lots of fun, but didn't hook me as much as I'd expected. Being a truly obsessive Who fan, I worried that other viewers might not understand what Autons were. I didn't feel that they or the Nestene Consciousness were really adequately explained. The pacing also worried me a bit; it struck me as rather frantic, and I worried that if I so much as blinked, I'd miss something. But then the ratings came out, and all worry swept away. People definitely watched it, so I need not fear that the Doctor will be going away again.The second episode, ""The End of the World"", allayed any fears that I might have had for this being a shallow, inadequately explained bit of eye-candy, a la so much of American sci-fi (especially sci-fi movies). It was more deliberate, the structuring was superb, and the exposition was revealed gradually as needed, rather than dumped on the viewer in a single chunk at the beginning. Cassandra, voiced brilliantly by Zoe Wannamaker, was extremely disturbing, as I believe she ought to be. And there was a moment where the Doctor showed real rage. Not a wild raving violence, but a cold, focused rage at the needless death of one individual, driving him to seek retribution. Some fans will argue that that's out of character, but it's not. It's happened even on the classic series. There is also a surprisingly graphic death at one point. Biggest of all, and this is a warning that may help some fans to be prepared, there is a major revelation about Gallifrey. I won't tell you what it is, but even though I knew there was a revelation coming, it totally surprised me when it did. It doesn't take up much of the episode, and doesn't really affect the plot (although it does affect the relationship between the Doctor and Rose). But it's pretty major. I know it will have to affect the fan-fiction I write. It's...not anything I'd ever dreamed might happen. I'm still not really sure how I feel about it. So be warned, Whovians. It's a lot easier to take if you know it's coming. ;-) It may make for interesting stories in the future, and it definitely does make us think twice about the Doctor's motivations on the new series. Suffice to say, this is the loneliest Doctor we've ever seen. There's a reason he was so desperate for a new companion in ""Rose"".",POSITIVE,0.9989705085754395
,I have every available episode on DVD. The first Doctor I remember was Tom Baker and he got me interested in the whole show. I've watched since the 80s. I even have the movie. Every season has had a horrible episode or story but was still worth owning. This garbage for however long it continues will not be considered as part of the series by me.

,"""Torchwood"" will be referenced throughout the series. Also in the 12th episode of series 1 the Anne Droid asked ""The great cobalt pyramid is built on the remains of which famous old Earth institute?"". The correct answer being ""Torchwood"".This is laying the groundwork for a spin off series, Torchwood, which will be set inside the institute which we now know to be founded by Queen Victoria, located in Cardiff and staffed by none other than Captain Jack. The rumour is that it will be aimed at a higher age range than Doctor Who and will be a Doctor meets Mulder and Scully type affair. Sounds promising.***mild spoiler follows*** Back to Doctor Who, though. It's great to see that the standard of the first series is being kept up in Series 2. David Tennant is proving a worthy successor to the miserable northern git Christopher Ecclestone. A lighter touch, but can kick ass when required, even when armed with just a satsuma. Also lovely to see Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as Sarah Jane Smith after 30 years along with not-so-furry doggy companion K9. This was a beautiful example of how the naughties' incarnation of Doctor Who is far more thoughtful and reflective than the old while still retaining the original spirit of adventure and fun. There's an emotional depth here which the previous incarnations moved mountains to avoid. Great stuff. Major kudos to all concerned with bringing this to the screen.",NEGATIVE,0.9996938705444336

,"Well, can I get my gripes out of the way first? I hate the fact that the Doctor is listed as 'Doctor Who' in the end credits, as was the case in the bad old days until the dawn of the Fifth Doctor's tenure. HATE it. His name is The Doctor for heaven's sake; seeing him erroneously named otherwise invariably sets my teeth on edge, and regrettably taking a big backward step is what the producers of the new series have decided to do. Dammit. One black mark. Secondly, the closing music only features the classic main motif repeating and entirely leaves out the euphoric higher-key 'middle eight' that was always my favourite part of that magical theme tune. Two black marks.Two black marks. And that's it. Not bad going in the grand scheme of things, when I have to scrape such a barrel of pedantry to find negatives to comment on. As for the rest, a whole hatful of gold stars is to be handed out to all departments as far as I'm concerned. The performance of Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor was everything one could have hoped for: human, yet definitely alien; wise, yet silly and on one occasion extremely and hilariously dense; calm, then angry, then comic by turns. He bounds through the direst danger with a ready joke and a dazzlingly broad grin upon his face (strangely reminiscent of an illustrious predecessor) that make it all the more affecting on the occasions when he abruptly sobers up, such as his spine-tingling monologue about feeling the turn of the Earth beneath him. It's good to see Billie Piper matching him in this regard: her Rose convinces as a bored 19-year-old who accepts the Doctor barrelling into her life in full flow as he does ours, doesn't flinch when the world threatens to collapse around her ears, and suddenly sees there could be so much more to existence than a dead-end retail job  and she leaves the fretting and screaming to others.For, of course, this is a thoroughly 21st century update to the series we knew and loved. Rose was never going to be a helpless accessory to the Doctor's mad schemes in this liberated age, but then again that's old news  the same was true of Ace seventeen years ago. What has changed is the overall look and feel of the programme; considering its age, Doctor Who has never looked better or moved faster. The visual scope has suddenly, dramatically broadened: with immeasurable advances in CGI and bigger budgets to work with the effects are now terrific, the TARDIS interior has had a striking industrial-organic makeover, and a long-overdue emancipation from studio-bound claustrophobia has finally released Who into the great outdoors for a large proportion of the action  literally a breath of fresh air. It was odd, as someone who knows Cardiff well, to see shots of the city centre masquerading as London intercut with views of the real London, but I'll let that slide. The rate of said action is breakneck: the self-contained format of the new 45-minute instalments will leave no room for the oft-maligned 'Episode 3 lag' factor of the old stories, and from the opening zoom into London from Earth orbit to the final shot of Rose running for the TARDIS the berserk pace never lets up. You're literally gasping for breath on occasion, not least because the programme is surprisingly and enchantingly laugh-out-loud funny at numerous points. All credit to Russell T. Davies for his sparkling script that gives the Doctor and Rose several excellent exchanges, with a cast of memorable supporting characters including a plastic version of Rose's boyfriend Mickey, her mouthy, flirty mother, and a conspiracy theorist tracking the Doctor's trail through history while maintaining a website that is a neat nod to the geekier edges of fandom.Shepherding his baby into the limelight is a task that Russell T. has to undertake while walking a tightrope. On the one hand there is that very base of fandom, established in the forty prior years of the programme's existence; on the other the new audiences just waiting to be tapped, today's generation of eight-year-olds sitting down with their parents ready to have their minds opened if the new Who is only good enough to do it. If he can please both camps without toppling too far to one side or the other then he'll be able to feel very proud of himself. This first roll of the dice was a good indicator: by bringing back the Autons (although they are never referred to as such) he is using a familiar but not too familiar foe that can translate to scaring anew the modern audience whilst being inherently, well, crap enough to be a subtle dig at former production values. Talking of which, the BBC sound error that briefly threatened to turn the opening scenes into Terror of the Nortons was an amusing reminder that nothing is entirely sleek and well-oiled in the Whoniverse Yet, for the first time in years, the BBC are treating this venerable institution with the respect it deserves; following a lengthy buildup and mouthwatering selection of trailers there was a palpable sense on Saturday teatime of sitting down as a nation to be transported together to another world, one lost to us for far too long but that is suddenly and joyfully here again to be explored once more. Coupled with the aforementioned catalogue of plus points, Mr. Davies appears to be successfully out onto the tightrope. If anyone can traverse it, he's probably the man: he loves this baby, it's extremely plain to see  and he's got the whole of time and space to let it play in.Long may it play.8.5/10",POSITIVE,0.9851773977279663

,"I began watching Doctor Who late in its own progression. By the time I had actually given it a shot, it was already on the 11th Doctor. I remember watching the first season with the 9th Doctor and thinking, ""Holy moly, this is cheesy."" and I immediately dismissed it. That was my first mistake.Doctor Who is a series that becomes apparently amazing to you after you connect with a Doctor and Christopher simply wasn't the Doctor I connected with. David's 10th Doctor was the one who made me fall in love with the series. He was sassy, intelligent, empathetic, and at times volatile. And as you continue to watch the series you begin to feel a connection with these characters because you begin to enjoy their adventures. You root for them, you feel a sense of loss as people come and go in the series, and you generally grow to love them.The series is simply about an alien (alien to us ;p) traveling through time and space in his Tardis (time/space machine). He is a benevolent observer so to speak; but more times than not, he involves himself with the people he encounters. And more times than not, he has a companion. The relationship between the Doctor and the companion is a very important aspect to the show and always rather charming. They fight, they laugh and they get into a lot of trouble, but the series itself becomes truly special as you continue to watch it.The moments throughout doctor who can make you laugh, cry, angry or whatever else it wishes to draw out of you. And the show has strong enough writers to be able to do that successfully.But be warned, if you fall in love with Doctor Who, that is the kiss of death. You will become a Whovian. You might even resort to watching the classic black and white episodes just for a fix (;p). The show has always selected its cast smartly and the stories it presents are always well constructed. Some episodes are better than others; but overall, the show is quite an amazing piece of art within its respective genre and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good heartfelt, fun, intelligent, and adventure driven sci-fi.",POSITIVE,0.9997066855430603
,"Russell T Davies and his fellow producers and directors have updated the classic Dr Who saga. The main players Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper give a new edge to a SF phenomenon. The stories are well written, creative and original with humour & pathos. The new series uses up to date CGI effects. This supersedes the creaky sets and low budget spend on the previous series. In addition this doctor is more emotional as the love interest with Rose Tyler testifies. The sole Dalek story was a thought provoking episode comparable to the classic Tom Baker episodes. As with most TV and Film franchises you have to suspend reality, e.g. the Dr is never asked for any ID and always commands action from authoritative figures usually with success. Losing Christopher Eccleston is a big blow although David Tennant has a proved track record in dramatic series such as the acclaimed Casanova. Overall an outstanding success as witnessed by the current ratings. I look forward to meeting the Cyberman, The Master and the other familiar characters from the series.

Though I admit there were moments I thought were iffy, the whole production had a class and style which made me think ""Wow, this is new Who and it's going to be great!""

Granted, we didn't get a very detailed introduction to the characters, but they have time. The new series may be difficult to understand for newcomers, there are a bundle of references to the original show, but, again, they can explain over the course of the series. Christopher Eccleston has a fairly similar character to Paul McGann in the role as the Doctor, rushing around doing things and not telling the companion enough about anything, being puzzling in a slightly over-dramatic way, etc. The first episode plays a bit like a zombie movie, except without the gore. The special effects are beautiful, unlike in the 70's when there was the BBC budget crisis. The only thing they need now is a more fearsome enemy, the autons don't pose as much as a threat to humanity as daleks (although they are noticeably more mobile...), but I recall mention of an episode with daleks later in the series, so I hope they make the most of their standards as top villain.",POSITIVE,0.9996563196182251

This acting ability could only benefit the BBC and its upto them to try & get him back!! The pilot was'nt perfect because of the plastic baddie, which lets face it has always been a dodgy idea with no real scientific basis. Don't forget your also addressing a star trek audience here who know their stuff, as well as the general audience of course, but this just came across as daft. Sci-fi must be serious to create tension, making the jovial bits more valued, therefore funnier when they happen.Chris's blatant northern accent is'nt what our parents are used to, they always want william hartnell, rather than real world accent, which, I think adds credit to the character and makes it more believable for when we actually are, hidden behind the settee... The ONLY PROBLEM here was WITH THE WRITERS, and NOT CHRIS'S or BILLIE'S performances. ..It seems chris took a style like tom baker at his most jovial, for that particular episode. which was a good approach considering the storyline, honestly who thought that stupid wheelie bin idea up (tsk), and they've shamelessly still got on the website, like its funny?, sorry NO its just bloody silly! Did they ever think that this would sit well with the star trek fans out there? Don't get me wrong, I know this was one of the main baddies from the 80's (i think) and there's nothing wrong with it really as it IS accessible to the general audience, but NOT FOR THE PILOT!!, where everyone is ready to either cheer or pounce. Nowadays for a PILOT the science fiction must have SOME scientific credibility (other than, its an alien), or people just shake their heads. This was a mid-season episode really.I wanted my dad to get into this as well as me, but the pilot is when everyone it most open about a comeback, but the wheelie bin, and mobile phone bits didn't go down too well.Anyway all this said, and the ending got me REALLY excited, when it gave you a preview of EPISODE 2, now this looks good, and I really cant wait.CHRIS ECCLESTON, I don't believe that 'typecast' excuse for leaving for one second, it was more to do with the article 'Doctor No' in one of the tabloids i'll bet!

Instead, go out and purchase about a case of Ex-Lax. From the sound of things, it'll improve your outlook on life considerably.Having said that, if it simply isn't your cup of jelly babies, I can deal with that. But getting your knickers in a twist because of the debut villains (the Autons were chosen, I'd expect, because they are simple to depict, easy to costume for, and dead simple to script and thus conducive to helping the series get its sea legs back) or because the new control room took extensive visual cues from the McGann movie, then please do Who fandom a favor and simply go away. Whiny misanthropes nitpicking the series to death aren't doing Doctor Who any favors, they're just being bitchy.Besides, ripping an entire series based on a debut episode is the mark of an amateur playing to the bloodthirsty.In short, grow up and p*ss off.

,"This is the first time I've felt completely undecided over the critical success of a film / television production. Whilst far from perfect, this opening episode is a quirky romp that reenergizes a previously-waning series. The seemingly relentless 45-minute format is welcome, although this suggests little consideration for character development in the near-future. Christopher Eccleston provides what may transpire to be the most intense Doctor, although he plays second-fiddle to Billie Piper's unexpectedly well-acted Rose  who effectively 'saves the day'. The superficial Auton plot succeeds in introducing the protagonists, although the situations and scenarios are somewhat so-so. Camille Coduri and Noel Clarke's respective acting leaves much to be desired. Mark Benton's Clive and the whoisdoctorwho site could be deemed cringe-worthy  was this aspect necessary? Likewise, some of the more self-demeaning moments: Auton Mickey's 'double take' and the Auton wheelie-bin's belch. The opening and closing theme is excellent homage to the Delia Derbyshire/Ron Grainer original, although Murray Gold's incidental music is all wrong. Additionally, Russell T. Davies' dialogue requires strengthening, although there are admittedly some chirpy one-liners. Keith Boak's direction does the job. Overall, this entry radiates an underlying 'getting on with it' attitude, with which it succeeds, unlike the contrasting Doctor Who (1996) tele-movie  which introduced the new Doctor at about the half-way point. This new Doctor's simplistic and less dandified choice of attire emphasises this new cutting-to-the-chase approach. The Autons are never referred to by name, suggesting that references to the past will be minimised and used only where necessary  these stories will stand on their own. The new Doctor shows promise, although Billie Piper may well threaten to upstage him (again?). Bottom-line: he's back, and it's certainly about time!  just take it lightheartedly and not too seriously. *** J",NEGATIVE,0.9667547345161438
,"I just wanted to say it was fantastic as the Doctor enjoys to point out. The first series of the new Doctor Who was very well thought out, and very well thought out, the storyline although occasionally juvenile was aimed at the younger generation and worked quite well. It was easy to understand, the dialogue gave the show a witty edge which made it quite humorous and gave the Doctor a side easy to relate to.Christopher Eccleston was a brilliant Doctor, although I was surprised to see him in a leather jacket we must keep up with times and he *did* change his jumper on occasion. He was deep and witty and showed the Doctor's many dimensions and gave light to his past and with the 'moody' parts i think he did quite well due to the fact he could also bring a cockiness as well. Billie Piper was an endearing associate although at the end of the day her performance wasn't the most important. With the introduction of the New Doctor could their relationship be in slight jeopardy? I always loved the quite subtle feelings between of the deep caring they had for each other and the eventual fact that Rose must truly love the Doctor etc. (call me a romantic i don't care) David Tennant although a very entertaining actor seems to be set to do quite well although i'm not 100% sure that he will bring the same deep and emotional Doctor Christopher Eccleston was very good at, i am willing to give him a chance though. From what i've seen he should be an entertaining, he has the cockiness of the old Doctor and loved his soliloquy after waking up on the Christmas invasion. Although he did attempt to be serious on occasion he did cock it up with lion king part. Although i thought it was funny so fair enough. We shall see how well he will do in this new year.",POSITIVE,0.9768419861793518
,"Not sure if this really contains a spoiler but just to cover myself. Great end to what has been a superb series. Christopher Eccleston is one the best actors in Britain, and the new guy David Tennant is fast becoming one of the best (he won a theatre award recently), but I hope he sticks around a few years. Billie Piper has been a revelation in the role of Rose. After a ""slow"" start in episode 1, it just went from strength to strength. First and foremost , it was a good drama,with wide appeal, as opposed to a piece written for a cult SCi Fi niche TV audience. Ruusell T Davies and his team, got the writing and the whole tone of the show ""spot on "". It has become a ""must see"" show again. Let's hope series 2 and 3, are equally as good.Martin D",POSITIVE,0.9993038177490234
,"The new Doctor Who series is not available in the states yet, but with a little know how, you can view the new episodes. If you have never seen Doctor Who before, you don't have to, the new show covers everything you need to enjoy yourself. I was skeptical at first, considering Producer/Writer Russel T. Davies had new ideas for the program, but I was not disappointed. The new series is just as exciting, clever, witty, and entertaining as the old episodes. It sticks to the continuity of the Doctor Who universe quite well and has even gone as far as to divulge new information. I highly recommend viewing this program whenever it becomes available in the states, especially if you are a long time fan.",POSITIVE,0.9997038245201111
,"What can i say? Who is back. And I cannot be more enthused. Chris Eccleston surprised and surpassed my expectations, I even got used to his northern, as opposed to distinctly posh middle class middle england, accent. I can only hope that David Tennant carries this on (I suspect he will). And do you know why? Because of the likes of Russell T Davies and writers Mark Gatiss who (no pun intended)believe and love the series. Forget the Anglo American nightmare (talk about friendly fire) with Mr McGann (no disrespect Paul but the script? half human? this is a Gallifreyan not a Vulcan. The Doctor is here to stay..and do you know what? My son is only three and he recognises a Dalek. Ah, a fathers pride>",POSITIVE,0.9995279312133789
,"I am not sure weather or not i am into the new doctor. I got used to Christopher Eccleston as the doctor and he was perfect for the part. It is just a shame that he felt compelled to leave after one season because of the fear of type casting. He was just starting to show a different side to the doctor that no one had seen before. This time lord had been through many centuries of being on his own that he finally finds someone that he cares enough to be with and form a romantic bond with. In the same instance, Rose falls for his charm and strange ways to fall in love with him. If he had stayed on as the doctor, it is quite feasible that the spark would have grown. Now we have the new doc, and it will have to start all over again. No doubt i will get accustomed to him, but the bond seems to have gone that they shared. Maybe they will get it on and they have a guaranteed 2 seasons with David tenant to sort it out, but for now i will wait and see what will happen and hopefully the new doc will grow on me just as the old one did. RIP Chrisopher Eccleston, you will be sadly missed.",POSITIVE,0.9980453252792358
