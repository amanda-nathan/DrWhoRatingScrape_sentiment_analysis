# DrWhoRatingScrape_sentiment_analysis
 A scrape and HuggingFace Fun
 
 Please note that in my python notebook where I do sentiment analysis I do have an unnecessary implementation where I basically do the computation twice. I just noticed that. I'll remove that when I get a chance but for now please note that this works at least. (Or feel free to submit a PR and I'll review).
